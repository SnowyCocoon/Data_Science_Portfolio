# Data Science Portfolio (Dominik Strza≈Çko)

Here you will find all projects related to AI/Data Science. Some of them will be available in this repository and some of them are a work in progress, or private. 

# Most important projects

## [Visual Simulation (CV :eyes:)](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Computer%20Vision/1.%20Visual%20Simulation)
It's a combination of two things that I love: Unity and AI. The first step in this project was creating a few scenes in the unity engine, that represent forests in different configurations (like day and night), with different trees, and then creating thousands of screenshots, of those scenes. The second step was to create a neural network (Multilayer Perceptron and CNN), that can recognize the type of tree on the image. Our team managed to receive the highest accuracy on our test set, and we also created the most realistic scenes.
**Tech stack:** Unity Engine, C#, Python, Tensorflow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas

## [TensorFlow - Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef (CV :eyes:)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dominikstrzalko/rhea-team-yolov5-infer)
It's our attempt to complete our first Kaggle competition. The task was to create an algorithm, to detect crown-of-thorns starfish on the bottom of the ocean, to get rid of them. We used the YOLOv5 model and trained it on the training dataset. We received the 1150/2026 place, with a score of 0.585. We used Weights & Biases to track training progress and the results.
**Tech stack:** Python, OpenCV, Weights & Biases, PyTorch, Pandas

## [Math/Finance Projects (Math :1234:)](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Math%2CFinance%20and%20Statistics)
A few projects related to math and finances. Two most noticeable are [Bootstrap version of T-Testing](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Math%2CFinance%20and%20Statistics/1.%20Bootstrap%20T-Testing/Bootstrapowa%20wersja%20testu%20t.ipynb) and [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Math%2CFinance%20and%20Statistics/2.%20MCMC%20(Markov%20Chain%20Monte%20Carlo)/MCMC.ipynb). Whole point of those projects, was to create those algorithms without any library besides numpy and basic math functions in python.
**Tech stack:** Python, Matplotlib, numpy, seaborn

## [My Masters Thesis and an Article - Voice Controlled Games (NLP :speech_balloon:/Gamedev :video_game:)](https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2021/pliks/143.pdf)
because I graduated with a master's degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, I wrote my master's thesis about controlling games with a voice in both the Unity engine and Godot engine. before finishing up my master's degree, I also participated in the FedCSIS science conference as a speaker, where I presented my results in the same field. I was able to win the Best Paper Award in the Young Researcher Workshop category.
**Tech stack:** Unity, Godot, C#, Microsoft Azure, Alphacephei Vosk, Windows Speech Recognition API in Unity, LUIS

# Less important projects



# Projects not related to Data Science/AI, but still connected to IT in general

## [My indie games (Gamedev :video_game:)](https://snowycocoon.itch.io/)
It is a collection of my games created both, for fun, and for competitions/hackathons (game jams). One of them "Card Planes" even won one of those game jams! If you want to try them, I recommend downloading the games. Some of them worked perfectly on the browser previously, but some changes from the itch.io side caused massive drops in FPS in those games.
**Tech stack:** Unity, Godot, C#, Gdscript, Aseprite, Gimp

## [Pagan Runer (Gamedev :video_game:)](https://gamejolt.com/games/pagan_runner/732468)
Game created for the United With Ukraine Game Jam. Epic adventure platform game in which you're a Slavic ruler that takes responsibility for his domain and his people.
**Tech stack:** Godot, Gdscript, Aseprite, Gimp
