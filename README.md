# Data Science Portfolio (Dominik Strza≈Çko)

Here you will find all projects related to AI/Data Science. Some of them will be available in this repository and some of them are a work in progress, or private. 

# Most important projects

## [Visual Simulation (CV :eyes:)](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Computer%20Vision/1.%20Visual%20Simulation)
It's a combination of two things that I love: Unity and AI. The first step in this project was creating a few scenes in the unity engine, that represent forests in different configurations (like day and night), with different trees, and then creating thousands of screenshots, of those scenes. The second step was to create a neural network (Multilayer Perceptron and CNN), that can recognize the type of tree on the image. Our team managed to receive the highest accuracy on our test set, and we also created the most realistic scenes.  
**Tech stack:** Unity Engine, C#, Python, Tensorflow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas

## [TensorFlow - Help Protect the Great Barrier Reef (CV :eyes:)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dominikstrzalko/rhea-team-yolov5-infer)
It's our attempt to complete our first Kaggle competition. The task was to create an algorithm, to detect crown-of-thorns starfish on the bottom of the ocean, to get rid of them. We used the YOLOv5 model and trained it on the training dataset. We received the 1150/2026 place, with a score of 0.585. We used Weights & Biases to track training progress and the results.  
**Tech stack:** Python, OpenCV, Weights & Biases, PyTorch, Pandas

## [Math/Finance Projects (Math :1234:)](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Math%2CFinance%20and%20Statistics)
A few projects related to math and finances. Two most noticeable are [Bootstrap version of T-Testing](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Math%2CFinance%20and%20Statistics/1.%20Bootstrap%20T-Testing/Bootstrapowa%20wersja%20testu%20t.ipynb) and [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Math%2CFinance%20and%20Statistics/2.%20MCMC%20(Markov%20Chain%20Monte%20Carlo)/MCMC.ipynb). Whole point of those projects, was to create those algorithms without any library besides numpy and basic math functions in python.  
**Tech stack:** Python, Matplotlib, numpy, seaborn

## [My Masters Thesis and an Article - Voice Controlled Games (NLP :speech_balloon:/Gamedev :video_game:)](https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2021/pliks/143.pdf)
because I graduated with a master's degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, I wrote my master's thesis about controlling games with a voice in both the Unity engine and Godot engine. before finishing up my master's degree, I also participated in the FedCSIS science conference as a speaker, where I presented my results in the same field. I was able to win the Best Paper Award in the Young Researcher Workshop category.  
**Tech stack:** Unity, Godot, C#, Microsoft Azure, Alphacephei Vosk, Windows Speech Recognition API in Unity, LUIS

## [Chatbot Janet (NLP :speech_balloon:)](https://github.com/SnowyCocoon/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/NLP/7.%20Hospital%20ChatBot)
It's a chatbot created as a final project during the "dialogue systems" classes at the university. It was a bot used to book a visit to the hospital. we used a dataset of text inputs and intents, and whole conversations divided into parts, that computer can understand, to train our bot. It contains different modules, that save user variables, choose the next act, or analyze text.  
**Tech stack:** Python, jsgf, conllu, flair

## Perfume Recommender (WIP) (NLP :speech_balloon:)
Together with my friends, including one that finished ISIPCA, one of the most prestigious schools for post-graduate studies in perfume, we are creating an AI-powered perfume recommendation system. Right now its based on data from various free databases of perfumes and scraped data from other websites about perfumes. We're using different technologies like tf-idf, doc2vec, or BERT to analyze user input of selected scents and description and recommend the best perfume for him. I work as a lead Python programmer on this project and also as a project manager.  
**Tech stack:** Python, nltk, sklearn, transformers, streamlit

# Less important projects, but worth mentioning (WIP)

## [My work as a Data Analyst for Hikari/Druga Era (Math :1234:)](https://hikari.pl/)
I work on a volunteer basis as a data analyst for one of the biggest Anime/Manga conventions in Poland. My main tasks are: scraping the data about competition, creating reports and presenting them to the management, and analyzing the ticket sales data, competition, and the data from surveys.  
**Tech stack:** Python, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, Microsoft Excel, Power BI

## Generative AI (WIP) (CV :eyes:/NLP :speech_balloon:)
Lately im more and more into Generative AI. I love to work with stable diffusion and try out different models, hypernetworks, and LoRAs. I've even trained some hypernetworks and LoRAs myself. I'm also trying to get more into Prompt Engineering to work better with LLMs and Image generation algorithms. I've also been able to create a few scripts using LangChain, to connect my favorite LLM with pdf documents.  
**Tech stack:** Python, Stable Diffusion, LangChain, LLMs

# Projects not related to Data Science/AI, but still connected to IT in general

## [My indie games (Gamedev :video_game:)](https://snowycocoon.itch.io/)
It is a collection of my games created both, for fun, and for competitions/hackathons (game jams). One of them "Card Planes" even won one of those game jams! If you want to try them, I recommend downloading the games. Some of them worked perfectly on the browser previously, but some changes from the itch.io side caused massive drops in FPS in those games.  
**Tech stack:** Unity, Godot, C#, Gdscript, Aseprite, Gimp

## [Pagan Runer (Gamedev :video_game:)](https://gamejolt.com/games/pagan_runner/732468)
Game created for the United With Ukraine Game Jam. Epic adventure platform game in which you're a Slavic ruler that takes responsibility for his domain and his people.  
**Tech stack:** Godot, Gdscript, Aseprite, Gimp
