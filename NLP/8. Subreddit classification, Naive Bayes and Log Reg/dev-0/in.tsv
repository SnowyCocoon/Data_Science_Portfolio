Well, I know it can decrease intraocular pressure, but as for *cancer...*\n\nThe only data I'm aware of relating marijuana to cancer is that it's an antiemetic and an appetite increasing drug. Which, while very good for patient health, are not directly related to the cancer itself, as much as a treatment of the adverse reactions of chemotherapy/radiation treatment (unless if the cancer is in the GI system, or is making weird hormones...).\n\nIf you have any information indicating that marijuana helps in cancer/HIV treatment *other* than as an antiemetic/appetite increasing medication, could you please provide it? I mean, I'm all for it's responsible use, but I don't want to go around spreading misinformation, especially if I'm going to one day be in the medical field.	1318558797

Unfortunately, there are no scientists currently modding or significantly contributing to online communities dedicated to the serious and sober research/discussion of UFO and related phenomena, that I am aware of.  Those who are doing the talking, including Reddit,  Above Top Secret, Open Minds, Coast to Coast, Nighthawk Zone, Cryptomundo, Talk Paranormal, MUFON forum and many, many others represent, at best, somewhat self-educated interest groups with relatively little knowledge and significantly more fluff.  In other words, they all have a pretty crummy signal-to-noise ratio.  It is always best to just read the literature first and come to these fora with a bulking arsenal of books and research under your belt.  All that takes time and, let's face it, most folk are not willing to make the effort to gain that depth of knowledge.\n\nI'm going to do you all a huge favor and point you to a blog from perhaps the greatest UFOlogist still living, though he would never admit to it as he is a deeply modest and innately spiritual fellow.  He is also one HELL of a UFO researcher.  You won't hear this guy on Coast to Coast.  He doesn't have a book out yet (Soon, or so I hear) but his blog pretty much covers the phenomenon from start to end with some incredible new and interesting insights.  He is a retired university professor who has recently had to stop posting due to family, and other, time constraining circumstances.  Here it is.\n\nThe Big Study:\n\nhttp://thebiggeststudy.blogspot.com/\n\nGo to the archive at the bottom of the page, beginning with 2009, and start there.  I guarantee you should consider this a full and comprehensive course on the history and events of UFOlogy (with some other seemingly random and eclectic topics thrown in for full measure)\n\nThis guy has either worked with directly or personally known nearly every UFOlogist you've ever heard of, and many of them still go to this guy for advice and research.  You won't find a better resource for UFO knowledge and history on the internet.  Good hunting and your welcome.  	1286948760

Damn. My hypothesis is shot.	1302539976
Technically, you are correct. All "organic" literally means is carbon-based, and using the same term to mean "food grown without chemical pesticides and fertilizers" is really a misnomer -- but I'll be darned if I can come up with an alternative. "Organic" will probably remain its nom de plume until someone figures out a better three-syllable-or-less term for it.\n\nThat said, calling it a "meaningless label" is inaccurate, because there are U.S. agricultural standards regulating what can and can't be called organic food, which growers have to meet or exceed. Those standards are available [here](http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop). So anything labeled "USDA organic" is grown by different rules than standard U.S. agriculture. That usually means grown without chemical pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nI've seen some interesting arguments for and against each. Chemical pesticides used today are probably safe to consume long term in the small quantities that remain on washed produce; you're not hearing about people keeling over dead from toxic shock at younger ages if they spent their lives eating food grown with chemical pesticides. On the other hand, DDT and pesticides like it that are now banned from use were once thought to be perfectly harmless, so an argument could be made that eating food without any pesticide residue is a perfectly rational way to avoid the issue entirely.\n\nChemical fertilizers are basically just synthetic nitrogen fixers and do exactly the same thing that manure, fish meal, and other natural fertilizers do. And synthetics are a lot easier to produce. On the other hand, natural fertilizers return a lot more raw organic (as in, carbon-based) material to the soil alongside the nitrogen, so you get less [leaching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_%28agriculture%29) and [soil erosion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion#Soil_erosion_and_climate_change).\n\nTo me, it seems likely that the health and environment benefits of so-called "organic" farming are small, but not negligible. It would be nice if there was a method of producing synthetic nitrogen that also replenished the organic matter density of soil.	1292361483

Somewhat short answer: homeopaths want to give u medicine watered down so that 1 in 10^30 parts is actual medicine and the rest is water.\n\nAnalogy:\nThe entire planet earth is 6 x 10^24 kg.\n\nThis means if you took **1 kg** of medicine and mixed it with about **1,600,000 earths** (or more than 4 suns), that's the ratio homeopaths are trying to get u to take as medicine.

Are you saying logic does apply to theism?  Or are you saying that logic should apply to theism?  If we agree that logic should apply that doesn't mean it does in practice.  I fall into the camp where I think skepticism is a science based endeavor and that things falling outside the realm of science do not apply.  Again, the age old question of where skepticism fits with regard to atheism.  It may simply be a matter of personal opinion as to the meaning of the word skeptic.  Bear in mind logic does apply to religious claims (young earth creation) but theism by its very nature has infinitely movable goal posts.  And these movable goal posts are perfectly feasible within the theist construct without causing the worldview to break.  How can logic apply in such a situation?  Not saying that is how it should be, just saying that is how it is.  That is why my personal opinion is that the original post is atheist in nature not skeptical.  Also please note that I chose the word theism for a very specific reason.  I didn't say Christianity, Islam, Hindi or even religion.	1298574901

I disagree. I can't find it now, but there was a study done where a largish group of people was shown 2 lines, one obviously longer than the other. One member of the group was not in on the joke, and answered correctly that the longer of the two was longer. Everyone else, however, had been instructed to answer in the opposite. \n\nIn many cases, the person would give in an agree, because they just assumed they were wrong, as the crowd must know best. \n\nThe conviction of being demonstrably right and yet ignored is different than someone being ignored while simply shouting his conviction. Even if both come out in feelings of frustration, they just aren't the same thing.	1325885432

Actually, no, I'm not arguing anything in terms of homeopathy.  At all.  Don't give a fig about it.  My point has been that the placebo effect - regardless of the trigger, whether it be sugar pill or whatever - is a testable, verifiable, scientifically repeatable effect that, at it's base, is a mental ability shown to exist, if not in any one individual, across the human race.\n\nRandi didn't specify that mental abilities had to be supernatural or that they had to be provable in any given person, only that they had to be scientifically verifiable.  The placebo effect is a mental power.  Give an inert substance to a test population who have been tested as suffering from any ailment and a sizable fraction will show improvement.  Every medical experimenter knows this and allows for it in their results.  They don't know what mental ability causes it but it happens.\n\nAnd that would meet all of Randi's challenge's criteria.\n\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\nNo need to go off on a homeopathy.	1304174208

&gt; but changing from an undeveloped to a developed country happens once in a country's lifetime, unless their society is destroyed.

I have to ask, why?\n\nThe goal is for everyone to be sufficient for themselves without foreign Aid. If that takes working, then so be it. It'd be great if all economies were successful enough as to not require people working, but i don't think we're there yet.\n\n&gt; However, with sweat shops, it is a self-defeating move. The mere act of working in them detracts from the quality of life.\n\nSource?\n\n&gt; Disease is rampant, as is death.\n\nSource?\n\n&gt; People live to work and work to live. It's a useless life. \n\nSource?\n\n&gt; Why try to implement a system in which people suffer more, compared to the current system, where we have some unemployment, which also happens in societies that do have child labor and sweat shops. In fact, because you enlarge the job pool (including children), your unemployment goes up.\n\nSource? Source? Source?\n\n&gt; And yes, minimum wage laws do "force jobs" to other places, but it also makes the US one of the richest people of the world.\n\nExcept for all those poor people on Welfare that can't even get a job to start with...\n\n&gt; Owners of large factories and big corporations aren't really suffering, and implementing sweat shops might give a few people jobs, but they would get less money overall. \n\nSource?\n\n&gt; The only people who benefit from sweatshops are the owners (at least in the developed world). That is why owners implemented them, after all. Sometimes, their interests add up, but most of the time, they do not.\n\nSource?	1342224390

For example, he says that we don't understand electricity, no one does, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  The explicit message is that electricity is a wondrous mystery.  The implicit meaning is that anyone who tells you differently is full of baloney, and clearly making things up, so don't trust them!  But there are actually many, many people (physicists and electrical engineers and chemists) that do very much understand electricity.  They know exactly what it is, and how it behaves, and why it does the seemingly magical things it does.\n\nSo if you were to take this guy at his word, and distrust the people who have spent their lives studying these phenomena, then the moment they started saying, "no, but look, THIS is how it works, we checked!"  you'd turn around and say, "pssh, no one understands electricity, and the fact that you think you do makes you delusional and not worth listening to."	1348711382

Why do none of these have sufficient explanations even for crazy shit?\n\nSo the Ring UFO, was it an actual ring or funky cloud?\nSeems like there was quite a few shots of what is clearly a cloud and the black ring is superimposed. Were the others ones also supposed to highlight where this cloud is or meant to be the actual UFO?\n\nHollow Earth? People actually believe this shit? So the earth is actually a small Dyson Sphere? Wouldn't the atmosphere be sucked towards the core, and not adhering to the inner wall? What of the expansion and contraction of gas? How do we account for the gravitational pull of the Earth, if it was hollow it'd have a much smaller pull. \n\nSky Hum? Sounded an awful lot like some kind of industrial sound.

You apparently deleted your two links before I could respond to them?\n\nI've read the first link before. It's not a condemnation of the WAPF but rather an argument against "holistic dental practices" or whatever, right? I have never seen the WAPF advocate any of those dubious practices. Like I said, their articles from trained biologists on, say, trans fats, on wheat and its effects on human metabolism -- these articles are rock solid, and I challenge you to show me otherwise.\n\nThe second comes from a vegetarian source. I agree with some of the things it says about Sally Fallon. And yes, the WAPF has a very anti-vegetarian bent. But, it's very inaccurate to say that the WAPF condemns the use of whole grains. \n\nIn fact, one of the biggest complaints in the from the Paleo diet camp is that the WAPF **advocates** the consumption of whole grains **when properly prepared via soaking, sprouting, fermenting, etc. and other "traditional techniques."** Some of the more strict Paleo people prefer to avoid these grains altogether, while some of the more permissive Paleo/Primal people are all for it. \n\nNone of these articles have attacked the credibility of the WAPF's core message on its own merits. As I understand it, the WAPF advocates\n\n* a diet based on real foods\n\n* preferably based on high quality meats and dairy; local, fresh vegetables and fruit; \n\n* rich in fat-soluble vitamins ADEK, \n\n* relatively high in omega-3 fatty acids, low in omega-6 fatty acids\n\nLook, I'm not a WAPF fanboy. I don't particularly care for their rhetoric, I think some of what they do is misguided, and I think the organization does a lot of things other than what Price advocated. But every time I see criticisms of the WAPF on here, I never see anything substantive. \n\nLike I said, the science-based articles from Masterjohn and Enig are golden. I have yet to see a credible criticism of their work. \n\nThe links you posted were:\n\nhttp://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/holisticdent.html\nhttp://www.vegsource.com/news/2009/11/reflections-on-the-weston-a-price-foundation.html	1290098083
&gt; I down voted you because you came on r/ufos to say that extra terrestrials dont exist because cameras. \n\nOK...  Aliens aren't visiting Earth because of a heck of a lot more than just cameras...  For instance, faster than light travel is physically impossible, and without it, the journey here would take almost forever (and require an insane amount of energy).  Of course, warp drive is theoretically possible (but would require even more energy).  And, just how did the aliens know we were here?  Unless they lived within roughly 60 light years, they couldn't possibly know that.  And, there aren't very many planets within that distance...	1348379110

I think it all depends on how you define "perpetual motion". The green water in the flask is cool, but even if it works a presented, it won't be "perpetual" due to evaporation. Once enough liquid evaporates to chnage the weight of the water pushing down, the machine will stop.	1356804338
Thanks for keeping this up, by the way. It's rare for people who've been targets of skepticism to be so open to criticism, and it shows integrity, which i do appreciate. (EDIT: Of course it's fascinating to me as well. Hope that's obvious.)\n\nI'll say that i'm skeptical of some of the responses you've shared. Precise acupoints are part of the historical and theoretical basis for acupuncture; if the precision turns out not to matter, what reason is there to support the theory of meridians at all? The acupuncturist's response that there may be an unlimited number of acupoints makes the theory itself basically useless. It sounds very much like an example of [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading). The fingertip acupoint objection to the negative EFT study sounds similar, especially given that the precision of points has been shown not to matter much in other applications.\n\nEssentially it comes down to this: It will always be possible to come up with an explanation for each problem with a hypothesis (like meridian theory) while maintaining that the hypothesis is true. (Carl Sagan wrote a [great illustration](http://www.users.qwest.net/~jcosta3/article_dragon.htm) of this principle.) We must decide for ourselves when the explanations become too cumbersome, too elaborate, or too implausible to be of any use, and the better explanation is that the hypothesis itself is wrong. (I'm invoking Occam's razor; have you come across it already?)\n\nAs a side note, there's a subtlety in the language that might be contaminating our dialogue, and i might be guilty of it myself. There are studies that *show evidence for* EFT, and there are studies that *do not show evidence for* EFT. It's not quite right to say that a study shows that EFT works or proves EFT, or to say that another study shows that EFT doesn't work or disproves EFT.\n\nAnyway, i took a closer look at [these studies](http://eftuniverse.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=#anxiety) on anxiety. Are there other studies on EFT for anxiety that you've come across other than the list at your third original link? It turns out that the literature there is weaker than i thought before. Basically, what needs to be shown for EFT to be accepted as a practice is that it is at least as good as, if not better than, standard psychotherapeutic methods. Of the 15 articles listed under "Anxiety", in three (3, 7, 8) the patients were self-selected, making the "study" just a collection of testimonials; two more (4, 6) were pilots; two others (5, 15) still used no controls; three others (1, 9, 10) used no treatment as a control (meaning, they compared EFT to no treatment, rather than an alternative treatment); one (12) compared EFT to a placebo version of itself; and one (13) was not a study. Of the three remaining that compared EFT to alternative treatment, two found either no difference (2) or inconsistent results (11). Only the [14th study](http://eftuniverse.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3570&amp;Itemid=2071) found EFT to be superior to an alternative ([progressive muscular relaxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_muscle_relaxation)). So, as it seems to me, the existing literature suggests that EFT is no better than other methods, or at least there is no reason to conclude *from* the literature that EFT is better, at relieving anxiety.	1343018825

If you're around the Terre Haute area (my hometown!), check out the Terre Haute Historical Museum and Mogger's Brewery (best restaurant in town).

Every time I go in there, I ALWAYS feel like I'm being stared at. And with Moggers, there's been a TON of sightings, weird feelings, temperature changes, etc. Its a very historic building in the oldest part of town.	1327262550
In terms of the burial at sea:  They had to take the body in order to confirm the identity.  Once you have it, what do you do with it?  If they held on to it, it would be seen as desecration.  It makes sense that Saudi Arabia would reject the offer, as they wouldn't want a terrorist shrine in their country.  \n\nWhether it's a proper Islamic burial may be questionable, but given the circumstances, it was probably seen as the least disrespectful alternative.  \n\nI think the story *was* questioned.  My first thought was, "Oh, really?  That's convenient."  And then my second thought was that making a claim like that without being absolutely certain would be unbelievably stupid.  I don't trust Obama as far as I can spit, but I don't think he's an idiot either.  	1304556352

&gt;Does a cat have any real understanding of enjoyment in regards to where it places itself?\n\nEveryone who's had a cat can probably answer this one with a "very likely yes".\n\n&gt;They are simple mammals without much comprehension aside from how to find food, mate, shit and sleep.\n\nActually, because they are such good hunters, cats (even in the wild) spend a lot of time idling. It is theorized that all that free time helps develop cognitive processes. Though not as trainable as dogs, they are said to be of similar intelligence.\n\nThey are also highly territorial and "possessive", i.e. they do have a territorial concept of ownership of places but also some objects. It seems likely the cat could definitely consider the box as part of his possessions.\n\nBut, yeah, this really doesn't have anything to do with /r/skeptic... :-)	1349540980

Very possibly. I've driven down that freeway at the time this had been shot many times for the past 6 months. I've seen very similar objects.

I was on the phone with my girlfriend when I started to see the lights. There were 4 flocks of 3 lights flying in a triangle formation.

&gt;I would keep an open mind about the Ouija board, you and whoever accompanies you has to believe it works\n\nThis is where it falls apart. People die of voodoo because they believe it works. That doesn't mean that voodoo is an authentic, repeatable, infallible ritual practice. All it means is that the human brain is affected strongly by believing in something.\n\nIf I truly, with all my heart, believed that every time the person across this office sneezed, that I would get nauseous and throw up, then I would very likely become nauseous and throw up everytime that person sneezed. But that *does not mean that their sneezing causes my vomiting*. It means that my *belief* causes the vomiting. It's an *extremely* important distinction.\n\nThings are either real or they are not real, and if personal belief is required in order for it to "work," then it doesn't actually work. In the soon-to-be-immortal words of astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson: "The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it." *That* is what makes something real. Your perception, your belief, your preconceived notions are irrelevant. It is true with or without you. Truth doesn't care about you one tiny little bit. The ouija board, clearly, is only effective if you believe it to be so, and that means it's your perception that makes it "real," and that means that it isn't actually real.	1335458681
The fnords reference is excellent and well-appreciated. The truth of the matter is that we are hardly credulous over at the Lamp. We are definitely aware of the occult and of the various interpretations of the global conspiracy dedicated to the total domination of every living man woman and child of this earth from now until eternity's dusk. But that doesn't make any of us more motivated to believe in the Corn Demon - probably less so, given what the Occult Elite are capable of.\n\nIt just as surely doesn't mean there's no such thing. I'm still inclined to think this is a metaphor for INS, either overt or unconscious and Jungian. And it may be a social workers' ploy to motivate interest in the plight of migrant workers. I'm not sure that would be a bad thing, either.

Not downvoted because you raise some points that are worth addressing.\n\nAn ad hominem is an argument against *a position* grounded in negative qualities of someone who holds it. The article would be making an ad hominem if, for instance, it claimed that we should believe in anthropogenic global warming simply because the people arguing against it are unreliable or corrupt. The article is instead making the case that Lindzen is unreliable and corrupt, and that he is a poor representative of the scientific community or of scientific thinking. It seems to me that their case is legitimate, if not airtight.\n\nMuch more importantly, dissecting the claims and credentials of specific deniers is not necessariy in order to simply observe that a scientific consensus has been arrived at, slowly and carefully, over several decades, due to the accumulation of a vast body of evidence that has won over almost every legitimate skeptic. Pretty much anyone who confidently asserts that global warming is fiction is either negligibly informed or a bona fide denier. Asserting that global warming is happening is not "advocacy"; it is science.	1330279177

The discomfort you are experiencing right now holding these two contradicting ideas at the same time is called 'cognitive dissonance', in a moment you're gonna try to Z in order to exclude Y from contradicting with X"\n\nMight come off as arrogant, so use at own risk!	1343343163

We went to the petstore to buy some feeder fish.  The girl fished them out of the tank and into the baggie and counted 5 (5 for a dollar), the cashier counted 5 and rung us up.\n\nOn the way home my son said Hey, there's 6 in here.  My wife verified, yep there's 6 not 5.  Cool, a free one!\n\nWe got home and put them in the turtle tank (an occasional treat)  and he started chasing them.  There were now 7 fish, further verified after he had eaten a couple (easy to see) there were still 5 left.  We all counted them separately several times.  I was confused.	1341775950

One of the key errors I find in the concept of machines making humans "obsolete" is that idea that machines are more efficient than humans by default. Look at what we need to survive and what we built with these little means. Compare that to running a machine. A single EMP strike could wipe out an entire machine population in one blow. A single virus could destroy a perfectly connected computer network. It's the "randomness" of life and humanity in particular that makes it so damn robust. Not perfect but perfectly tuned to this planet's environment.\n\nAlso, in the end, what will this super-intelligent machine being do? What's its motivation? Who will *define* its motivation? It will never be more than a tool and an extension of mankind's ideas. Maybe we will eventually send our brain waves to host bodys on Mars. But I doubt that we will let robots teach our children or write our music. 	1282438455

EDIT: here's the best document I got: [FBI report on UFOs in New Mexico](http://vault.fbi.gov/hottel_guy/Guy%20Hottel%20Part%201%20of%201/view)\n\nFrom the report:\n&gt;An investigator for the Air Force stated that 3 so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50 feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies, but only three feet tall, dressed in a metallic cloth of a very fine texture.\n\nA recent author has spun this as Russian children sent over by Stalin to freak the US out and cause a reaction similar to 'War of the Worlds'. That seems unlikely to myself, in that they would have done far better to fly into NYC or some other large city to promote such a feat - not the desert wilderness in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI don't think there is really a definitive 'smoking gun'. We have [FBI reports of an unidentified disc coming down  that is public knowledge](http://vault.fbi.gov/Roswell%20UFO/Roswell%20UFO%20Part%201%20of%201/view). We have countless mysterious videos that can be construed as dozens of explanations. We have high-level government and military people from all over the world who claim to have witnessed or experienced these craft in action, often doing incredible things. This evidence would be more than enough if we were dealing with any other subject on an academic level. We produce conjecture based on ancient history based on far greater assumptions, yet teach it as if we intimately know.\n\nThe key here is 'evidence'. The problem with UFO evidence is that it is given an extra layer of skepticism it must pass through because of the cultural connotations attached to the subject. It cannot be good enough to be mysterious and unexplained, we now demand incontrovertible truth that these things exist. \n\nSo lets start peeling back the layers. Who is involved that we can be sure of? The government. The government obviously wants nothing to do with the subject, as seen from the white house response to the Disclosure petition. This is the reason I cannot give you the hard evidence you want; it is not in the interest of those who hold it. That being said, there is a LOT of information out there to those who are willing to search for the truth. I think due to your skeptical nature it is best discovered by yourself, as I don't think you will take my opinion very seriously anyways :P\n	1321640854

Objectivity is not the issue. Their rights to practice cannot infringe upon another's rights. The law ought to be uniformly applied or it is worthless. If there is no unalienable right against discrimination then there is no reason to codify religious freedom to discriminate. Secular folk can easily discriminate against the religious at will and religious folk can routinely discriminate against differing religious folk as well.\n\nEdit: I wanted to elaborate because I think this is an important issue and I was using my phone when I replied. The key here is to understand that their may be no objective unalienable right from discrimination but when people's rights are protected on a secular level it also protects the rights of religious people. The religious do not need special protections from the likes of those who would infringe upon them. They already have Constitutional protections against that, just like everyone else. And any special protections they might garner cannot cause them to be able to infringe upon another. Otherwise, we risk creating a special religious class of people. Since we are in principle a classless society that would not do. And I say "principle" because we are not objectively a classless society. There are no objective natural laws that would preclude class structures. However, if religious folk decide they have the right to infringe upon others based on their personal or institutional beliefs then they must accept the risk of the other edge of the blade. Many conflicts have started because idiots like these insisted on special privileges that infringed upon others.	1337726460

Like maybe a string pull switch)  \n\nDoes the garage have a movement sensor for it's light?\n\nThere is a logical explanation, it's just a matter of working out what is happening.

well, i'm a lifelong nader voter. he isn't running this year, obviously. the only point upon which we disagree is nuclear power. since i'm not able to vote for him anymore, i want to prioritize voting for an atheist. because, seriously, religion shouldn't play ANY part in government, but it always does anyway. if a person is capable of believing the superstitious madness of a religion, then it is totally a factor because it underscores their reasoning at least and will affect policy at worst.\n\nEDIT: spelling	1345501876
It definitely seems to be the common thread in abduction/contactee cases. I think it's interesting, in that it both proves, and disproves the phenomena:\n\n If they are visiting, and giving advice about where we are heading, it makes sense that those warnings are consistent;\n\n If it is all in the mind, paranoid delusions, general psychological conditions, then it would also be consistent, because individual types of pathology share common features.\n\nA conundrum indeed!	1334704378

Wait but how are we talking to them if we haven't had death flashes or memorable accidents?	1354456610
I was surprised to see that your article focuses on the "don't be a dick" aspect of the talk because within the talk itself the "dick" part appears to play a fairly minor role. Perhaps it was more a reaction to other peoples reactions than a response to the talk itself?\n\nThe structure of his talk suggests that the talks purpose was not to lay down an eleventh commandment and then have lawyers contemplate what does and does not qualify as dickish behaviour. Instead, the goals were:\n\n1. To make people reflect on what they are trying to achieve in skeptical conversations.\n2. Put forward the proposition that if a person views you as a hated adversary then they are far less likely to change their position.\n\nThe "dick" comment only comes in as a corollary to these first two point. It is not that being a dick is inherently bad. It is just that if your goal is to change a persons mind then you should not act like a dick towards them because doing so makes it less likely that you will accomplish your stated goal.\n\nViewing things from this perspective clears up some of the questions asked in your blog post.\n\nIf you are chilling out with a skeptical friend is it inappropriate to say "Psychics are bullshit" because that might be a bit dickish? Answer: It is totally irrelevant whether or not the act is dickish because you are not trying to change your friends mind. You are trying to vent or engage in intellectual masturbation or something else. Being a dick in this context does not hinder you accomplishing your goal.\n\nIs it still ok to be aggressive given that aggression does not necessarily imply dickishness? Answer: Again, it does not matter whether aggression is or is not dickish. The only thing that is important is whether or not aggression runs counter to your goal. If being aggressive is dickish then yes it will be bad if your goal is to convince someone to change their mind. However, an approach can still be counter productive even if it is not dickish. Speaking in German does not make me a dick but if the person I am trying to persuade does not understand German then my breath is wasted. Aggression should be judged on its own merits in relation to each persons goals.	1299623477
The difference between MMS and ClO2 in the water is that the ClO2 in the water has more than likely decomposed into chlorine and oxygen. MMS advocates are telling people to drink it a couple of minutes after mixing it - therefore there will be ClO2 left in. Also, it's generally multiple doses per day.	1288303629

What a ridiculous straw man argument.  The vast majority of those skeptical of the global warming movement oppose not the science, but the proposed remedies, which in themselves are anti science.

I've always thought that "those things you hold to be true" are your beliefs, regardless of how you arrived at them.  Skepticism comes in when you evaluate or re-evaluate your beliefs.  Some people seem to draw some parallel between belief and faith, but I've never connected the two, except in the minimal sense that all belief, even scientific ones, need to rely on a certain level of faith (or maybe "trust" is a better word).	1312827897

Okay.\n\nThe majority of medical conditions seen by doctors in the United States are lifestyle-related.  Unfortunately, the medical system in the United States is weighted heavily towards acute conditions and weighted heavily against chronic ones.  A hospital is a great place if you have pneumonia or a broken arm or need stitches.  It's not the best place if you have insomnia because all your doctor can really do in the amount of time he has to treat you is give you pills and tell you to take naps when you can.\n\nNaturopathic medicine, [despite this subreddit's incessant need to turn it into Hitler](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ct1xb/the_wootastic_ralternativehealth_has_vanished/c0v1bet?context=2), presumes that the patient can heal themselves with the proper guidance and assistance.  We now live in a culture where pretty much everyone would benefit from an extra hour of sleep, for example, but none of them are making time for an extra hour of sleep unless their doctor orders it.  And he'll help them out by giving them Ambien.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of my wife's patients have issues related to food allergy, stress and environmental factors.  Whereas most of her clients would be treated with anti-depressants and anti-inflammatories, she treats them through determining what they're allergic to and what they can do to remove the antagonists from their lifestyles.  And, while doing it, she does a full health and medical workup on them including bloodwork, medical history and physical (her initial patient visits are an hour and a half) and, if need be, refers out to psychiatrists, psychologists, dieticians, oncologists, gynecologists, ultrasound technicians, pathology labs, obstetricians and general practitioners, all of whom are happy to take her calls because she's a doctor, practicing medicine, with a license.\n\nOh, I'm sorry.

The problem here is your presupposition that "any sensible military leader in 1950 would consider it important." Isn't it possible that the event was looked into, found to be inaccurate or hoaxed, then discarded as not of significance? Isn't it also possible that they had other things to do and didn't get around to it? Isn't it also possible that the report was found to be lacking in critical details and deemed to be not worth the resources?\n\nYou are starting with the assumption that there is more to this, but without evidence there is no reason to believe that. How would you go about distinguishing between these two possible realities?\n\n1. There are more related documents and the government is withholding them.\n2. No more related documents exist, despite your belief that more exist.\n\nPerhaps you feel differently, but I think that without evidence it is not possible to distinguish between the two possibilities. I'm not denying the possibility that more documents *could* exist, but until evidence is presented for their existence it is irrational to think they do.\n\nEven if they released more documents related to this, would you really be satisfied? The follow-up could simply say the informant was a liar and to disregard the previous report. Would you accept that as truth, or would you be inclined to say it is a doctored report meant to obscure the true investigation?	1302536668

I've been a paramedic for six years and we often have to turn off the lights in the back when doing a "12-lead EKG" because it picks up the 60Hz signal.  Moving and talking will *completely* screw up a 12-lead analysis.\n\nNow a regular 4- or 5-lead "monitoring" EKG won't be disturbed by nearby electronics, and it will only be momentarily effected by movement and talking, but a "diagnostic" 12- or 14-lead EKG will be rendered useless until you have an electronically clean environment in most cases.

That wired article is profoundly interesting. In particular:\n\n&gt; By the late '90s, for example, the classic antianxiety drug diazepam (also known as Valium) was still beating placebo in France and Belgium. But when the drug was tested in the US, it was likely to fail. Conversely, Prozac performed better in America than it did in western Europe and South Africa. It was an unsettling prospect: FDA approval could hinge on where the company chose to conduct a trial.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; Placebo-activated opioids, for example, not only relieve pain; they also modulate heart rate and respiration. The neurotransmitter dopamine, when released by placebo treatment, helps improve motor function in Parkinson's patients. Mechanisms like these can elevate mood, sharpen cognitive ability, alleviate digestive disorders, relieve insomnia, and limit the secretion of stress-related hormones like insulin and cortisol.\n\nSo, it's important to note that the placebo effect isn't just in the mind of gullible patients. It releases very real chemicals that have real physiological effects.\n\nIt would be very interesting to see how skeptics react in double-blind placebo trials versus how the average person reacts. I would bet the farm that a highly religious person who answered in the affirmative when asked if they feel the direct intervention of a god in their lives would be a high-responder to placebo.\n\nDrug companies may need to start profiling test subjects to more effectively filter out the placebo effect, since it has become stronger and harder to beat.	1347797264

"Kinetic energy" in the context of relativity usually means mc^2 * (1 - gamma), so it's 0 when a particle is at rest. It isn't really "kinetic" energy if it doesn't have that property.

Yesterday organic was the cure, but raw is the new black. Many do it because they think it's superior for other reasons than it is.\n\nMy point is there's a ton of homogenized bullshit spreading on this topic, and strictly supporting a more factually-based education of proponents would certainly not hurt, even if you don't go as far as recommending against drinking it due to health risks.\n\nAs far as your philosophy, though, I'm a smoker, and I hate people telling me I'm going to die of cancer. I'm educated on that topic, and I made my choice, and to hell with anyone who tells me I can't risk my life.

Yea, there was a tremendous amount of inbreeding in the Egyptian royal family. I had a National Geographic with an article on the study of mummies identifying 34 direct ancestors (I can't remember the exact number) the majority of pairings were between sons who married their sisters, producing children who then married each other having daughters who matured that then married their grandfathers/uncles as second or third wives, producing more children who married other offspring that were simultaneously their cousins/nieces/sisters/brothers. The string of genetic deformities this inbreeding produced was intense.	1321597331

&gt; You are quoting CNN.  \n\nNo, actually I read the research paper and the data (can't tell you the figure number because I don't have access right now) shows that both yoga and stretching are equal in their benefits.  That is exactly what the line you quoted states.  \n\nLook at it this way.  There are three possibilities: \n\n1. yoga (Y) &gt; Stretching (S);  \n2. Y = S;  or \n3. Y &lt; S.\n\nThe statement you quoted says "Y &gt; S is not true".  You are assuming this means that Y &lt; S.  If you look at the paper, the data shows that Y = S.  \n\nThe fact that stretching is just as good as yoga is an important finding.  The particular stretching regimen they used is atypical but the study definitely shows that just the physical aspects of yoga are sufficient for the benefit and not the spiritual or other pseudoscience, magical aspects can be thrown out of the window.\n\nEdit: Re-worded my response because I just realized that you wrote the article for Skeptical Science.	1319628039

The "robot with feelings" idea is interesting, and has been explored in fiction many times.

Many people use "homeopathic" to mean "herbal" or to mean non-Western medicine. It really shouldn't be surprising that the people who would use this aren't often the most careful with terminology. \n\nFrom the article:\n\n&gt; Mr Monsellato, 52, of the southern Italian town of Tricase, close to Lecce, has been a doctor of alternative medicine for more than 20 years. He is honorary president of Italy's Homeopathic Sinergy Association and an expert on acupuncture.\n\nSounds like they just like anything that isn't too "Western". 	1319414294
Sadly, that's not the way vaccines work. They don't make you immune, they just reduce the chance of an infection when you are exposed. They are most effective when everyone who can get vaccinated does so. When the community as a whole has reduced susceptibility to the virus, everyone's chances of being exposed at all go way down, and the virus is less likely to get a foothold in the population. This is what we call "herd immunity". When you get pockets of people who refuse to get vaccinated, they aren't just putting themselves at risk. They increase the chance of exposure for everyone around them, reducing the overall effectiveness of the vaccine. Then we start seeing outbreaks. We're seeing this more and more in the last 10 years with things like measles and pertussis (whooping cough).	1316720780
In the U.S., there are far more black professional football and basketball players than there are white. This is determined by ability almost exclusively. Whether this was a result of recent selective breeding or thousands of years of development in Africa, we don't know. Or at least I don't know.\n\nIt is possible that through the same mechanism, black people may be smarter or dumber (on average) than non-blacks in the U.S. It is not socially acceptable to perform this type of testing, so we probably won't know for a long time, if ever. In fact, it is not even socially acceptable to talk about this type of testing (intelligence by race), so I look forward to a large number of downvotes for mentioning it.	1326177547

To be somewhat fair to Steve, your diet can prevent or encourage the spread of cancer.  It has been found in studies that cancers require a lot of sugars to thrive.\n\nPg. 217 of Good Calories Bad Calories, "In the early 1980s, cancer researchers discovered that tumor cells also overexpress IGF (insulin-like growth factor) receptors, just as they overexpress insulin receptors.  The surfaces of tumor cells have two to three times as many IGF receptors as healthy cells, which makes them all the much more responsive to the IGF in their immediate environment.\n\nThis is another way in which cancer cells gain their all important survival growth advantage, suggests Derek LeRoith, whose laboratory at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases did much of this research.  The extra insulin receptors will cause cancerous cells to receive more than their share of insulin from the environment which will convey to the cell more blood sugar for fueling growth and proliferation; the extra IGF receptors will assure that these cells are supplied with particularly forceful commands to proliferate.  Another critical role of IGF in the development of cancer may be its ability to inhibit or override the cell suicide program that serves as the ultimate fail-safe mechanism to prevent damaged cells from proliferating"\n\nIn short, cancer cells have lots of receptors to factors in the body spurred on by insulin and IGF (which are very similar in effect and structure).  IGF concentrations change slowly over time compared to insulin however, so one must keep their diet fairly regular to keep this in check.  Shutting down these receptors in mice caused cancer cells to pretty much totally be supressed from growth.\n\nThis stuff could be outdated, but diet can have an influence, though the role of IGF is apparently controversial, as is much in cancer research I would imagine (though do not know).	1318001971

No, I did not say that Occam's razor = aliens. \n\nI am saying that it is much more reasonable to hypothesize that the myths and legends are all based on the same past event, rather than to make the leap that many different stories wildly separated people just, by some wild coincidence, have almost identical narratives. To me that smacks more of religion than science.\n\nSo if we assume that the stories are based on a past event, given the technological level of the ancient story tellers, what could account for that "event".  Obviously nothing of this Earth  in that time period. \n\nSo, assuming a real "event",  we are left with two choices for the source of the "event". 1: They really were supernatural beings. 2: They were flesh and blood beings. \n\nWhich is more likely?\n\nIf they were flesh and blood, where did they come from? Certainly no one in the ancient world could fill the bill. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	1322016956

"Remote viewing" actually closely fits with this.

Hey Romeo.  I guess that it's kind of a subjective matter, but I think you're giving a little too much leeway to the concept of what a jet aircraft should look like.\n\nI happen to have a little figurine that's meant to actually represent a jet aircraft.  I've taken a picture of it and placed it with the so called "Golden Flyer" so that you can see a direct comparison:\n\nhttp://www.dumbassguide.info/images/sitedisplay/jet_goldenflyer_comparison.jpg\n\nNow, I've already admitted that there's a very basic general similarity (I'm the dumbass who did that podcast, in case you were confused by the name I go by here). The wings, tail, and body are *kind of* similar in general location\n\nBut I think you need a lot more than that in order to call this Golden Flyer "eerily reminiscent of modern day fighter jets".  It seems to me that when you compare this object to something that's actually meant to represent a modern day fighter jet, the term "eerily reminiscent" doesn't really hold up.	1292049847

Damnit!  For some reason I can't [reach PubMed](http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).  Have you gone and [done a search](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)?\n\nMy first though it that it seems pretty much like nonsense.  Light turning into biochemical energy?  I thought photosynthesis was pretty much only the purview of plants...  Humans have a few photosensitive parts (eyes, and our skin responds in a few ways).

If you think you are in a formal debate, while the other person thinks it is a school yard bullying session - you won't get anywhere.\n\nIf the other person does not value truth, the scientific method, logic and rationality, then the conversation is doomed from the outset.	1355253836

Seems to me there's at least a couple things to be proven for me to believe this app's claims.\n\n* Does body movement correspond to wakefulness?\n\nThis seems to be false. During [NREM sleep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#NREM_sleep)'s stage 1, the body sometimes experiences [hypnic jerks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk). You experience stage 1 sleep both as you move to deeper stages of sleep, and as you rise back out of them. Thus the app may sense a movement due to a hypnic jerk as you're falling deeper into sleep, not waking up.\n\n* Is wakefulness the best time to end your sleep cycle?\n\nI didn't see any specific citations from a quick search. There's many studies that describe a lengthy list of negative effects of sleep deprivation, but that's when sleep is prevented or routinely interrupted. If you are otherwise getting sufficient sleep throughout the night, it's unlikely you'll have any of those serious sleep deprivation effects from an interruption of your last REM cycle. But will it make you less happy or less energized?\n\n\nIf you feel you want better sleep, or to feel better when you wake up, I bet you'll find more useful changes by reviewing your ["sleep hygiene"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_hygiene), [reducing caffeine intake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine-induced_sleep_disorder), and [exercising regularly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise#Sleep).\n\nI've been particularly interested in recent studies of [light and circadian rhythms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm#Light_and_the_biological_clock). When blue light roughly matching the intensity of an overcast day strikes the retina it can advance or delay the body's internal clock, and that affects the onset of sleep. This effect can accumulate and cause one's circadian rhythm to drift farther from the typical day/night cycle. It's something to consider when staring at a monitor or smartphone at night. You may be sabotaging your sleep.	1334696051

Prior to about 5-10 years ago, someone who was a gay trans man was literally almost never allowed to transition. There are plenty of gay and bi trans men (me, for instance).  I think I'd be bi no matter what, but it's possible I am out about it because after coming out as trans and transitioning, a little thing like sexual orientation doesn't seem as big a deal. Most cis bi men seem to, on the other hand, be shall we say circumspect about who they tell (aka on the DL).  I really doubt there are more gay and bi trans people I think we just tend to be more out about it.	1323385996

I don't mean to argue with the hivemind here, but this is hardly crazy talk. \n\nThere is a ton of evidence to show that quantum effects occur in natural processes. The processing of scent, photosynthesis, bird migration, etc. That the mechanism behind consciousness could have quantum mechanical underpinnings is hardly the sort of woo that should be dismissed out of hand.\n\nIt's of course wise to expect to see evidence that supports the theory, but it's not really all that far out there.\n\nWe shouldn't just discard potentially interesting study on the basis that a specific field is rife with bullshit. It doesn't help when he's going on things like What The Bleep Do We Know, but it's not at all uncommon for someone to be on a documentary where the overall subject matter misrepresents their view. The Great Global Warming Swindle is a good example.\n\nFor the record, I'm just talking about the overall theory of consciousness having quantum properties or mechanisms. The near death experience, consciousness in the universe, thing... that's all pretty wacky.\n\nOh, in looking around I discovered another article referencing the same theories.

I took a tour of the ship when I was a lad where they show you all the "hotspots" of activity. I thought it was pretty hokey until we got to some of the crew quarters.

I said "about what?" thinking it was the tour guide, then I noticed she was a good 8 feet away out in front of the group.

&gt;More regulation is better than letting a bunch of quacks run amok. \n\nExcept that all they're regulating here is requiring naturopaths to have a sufficient "education" in naturopathy (a lateral move at best) and restricting the procedures they can perform (a definite boon). However, all Joe Uninformedcitizen knows is that the Alberta goverment said naturopaths are medical professionals, so he's all the more likely to seek one out (and hopefully he at least goes to one that's "accredited") instead of seeing an actual, y'know, trained medical professional. *All* the snake-oil peddlers will see an uptick in business as belief that magic-whatever will cure what ails you spreads, and I don't know that the fact that some woo-peddlers will be certified as being less-harmful to your health than others is all that big a win given the costs.	1343318731

Well, as they stated in the video, it is just extremely efficient, using gravity as the power source, but eventually, it will wind down. Making a device that runs for 3 days isn't terribly difficult. Making one that runs for 3 years, more so. \n\nI don't think the horseshoe magnets are actually doing anything like the inventor states. The ball is perpendicularly located and ~8 inches away when they're up, which is supposed to propel the ball, but move them down ~1 in and suddenly they have no effect on the ball's momentum? I used to do a lot of patent work and very often we'd have inventors that would describe their inventions, but at one step, they would describe something that broke the laws of physics or was just plain ridiculous, and we'd be forced to figure out what the hell was really going on. The device does not work the way the inventor thinks it does. \n\nThe overhead magnets, springs and pendulums are doing all the work. The horseshoe magnets may actually be serving as a brake when the ball passes in front of them. You'd need speed readings at every angle to really figure out what's affecting what. 	1350236727

I've been practicing meditation daily for about two years now.  I heard a man say that when his solar plexus becomes large enough to touch his root chakra or sacral chakra, he is able to produce an electric shock through his hands.  I have attempted to energize my chakras for spoon bending and moving small objects through telekinesis.  With out much success my focus went else where.    The funny thing is my girlfriend gives me the most amazing energy in my penis/genitals/prostate area when she flirts with me.  She really is on an elevated level sexually.  Maybe my sacral chakra is just overly active and giving me the necessary energy for moving objects through telekinesis. Thank you, that made sense to me.

It would have to be pink slime and beef, not chicken. But my first-hand knowledge comes from the pet supply industry, where I highly recommend avoiding even the dog foods that use by-products (which is what they call the stuff that goes into pink slime), because of the lower protein and nutritive values.\n\nBut as to [pink slime](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/03/27/pink-slime-deconstructed/) in particular:\n\n&gt;But, is it nutritious? Consumers can certainly make valid arguments regarding LFTB’s content: there’s less overall “functional” protein than that found in other meat products. An analysis conducted at Iowa State University (A.S. Leaflet R1361) found two-and-a-half times more insoluble protein (77% vs. 30%) relative to soluble proteins in ordinary ground chuck. Nutritionally, our gut bacteria digest much of what we cannot, but there’s a good bet that we can’t get as much value from insoluble proteins (collagen and elastin, found largely in tendons, ligaments, and cartilage) as from their soluble siblings (myosin and actin, usually associated with muscle tissues). \n\nThe various vitamins and such will of course be different, but that's also dependent on what the animal was eating. Any place putting pink slime in their ground meat is using incredibly low-quality meat to begin with, so lowering the nutritive value even further seems unwise.	1333638485
&gt;the debate would quickly reduce to one about things like material properties - which have clear values and are hard to argue about.\n\nUnless maybe the WTC towers were built of materials that weren't meticulously tested and analyzed before assembly... which they weren't.

Actually it goes both ways whether you like it or not. You can't make empirical claims if you don't have empirical evidence. Not unless you want to be called a pseudoskeptic.\n\nI also believe you did not understand my post. You don't have to believe in spirits, and you can say that "there is no evidence for spirits" to refute anyone's claim that they have seen one and you would be correct to say so. However, you can't say "There are no spirits" for then you are making a claim.	1348126368

I'm confused on that part, though. How is the Bible eyewitness testimony? Perhaps the Gospels could be considered such (if there are persuasive reasons to conclude that the authors whose names are attached are actually the authors), but certainly the book of Genesis can't be counted as such, even by Christians, since no human existed to witness creation! So what exactly does "eyewitness testimony" mean to these people? I'm very confused.	1335562387

While most are sure something matching the symptoms of fibromyalgia exists, we aren't quite certain it's not somewhat psychosomatic in origin. The fact that SSRI's have efficacy in resolving fibromyalgia suggests there's at least some psychological component to some cases. This psychological component will be well out of the scope of a chiropractor.	1337667908

I've had my own sighting and yet I'm still skeptical.  What I saw was incredible; two pin-points of light, like stars, chasing each other across half the sky, darting back and forth and pulling off instantaneous stops and full reversals, lasting for about 30 seconds but long enough for my dad to see it too.  It was like nothing I've ever seen.  That being said, I don't know what it was, and that's about it.  I know full well that when I tell other people they're likely not to believe a word of it, or at least present a sort of healthy skepticism of the sort that I also employ when reading about or hearing reports of other people as well.\n\nTLDR; It's okay to believe as long as you're critical about it. As soon as you stop being critical about it, the worse the signal-to-noise ratio gets.	1323763381
&gt;at that speed no time passes for the photon.\n\nThat's not quite right either. It doesn't really make sense to talk about how much time passes "for a photon" (generally accepted to mean "in the photon's rest frame) because the photon doesn't *have* a rest-frame. To make the statement more precise, we say that there is no Lorentz-invariant parametrization of a photon's trajectory. What that means amounts to basically the same thing: that photons can't evolve between their emission and their absorption, e.g. they can't spontaneously decay.	1332927067

gamerlen is right. People who are tricked or forced into cults (by being socially outcast -with the other "SP"s- or by threats of eternal damnation) aren't at fault, and they aren't weak minded idiots.

Doesn't necessarily have to be 'bumping the cord.'  If there was a loose connection somewhere (inside the lamp or in the cord or in the plug) even a slight vibration could have screwed up the connection.  This happens to me sometimes with my mp3 player if I'm not careful to secure the headphone jack properly.  Every time I move, the sound can cut out in one or both ears or get softer in one or both ears depending on how I move.\n\nAs for the white blob, one thing that popped into my head is a light spot.  Maybe you were sitting such that you had a bright light just barely in your peripheral vision.  When you started moving your eyes, the light appeared to move because the spot stayed in one spot in your vision while you looked around.  After a second or two of looking around, your eyes adjusted and the spot went away.	1337831841

That whole area was kind of a mess of mostly USSR but also Finnish and Swedish submarine and general underwater playground during the cold war. Most conspiracy theories about it is more about what the USSR pulled off there and to a lesser degree what Sweden/Finland pulled off or did to monitor it. It's certainly overstated to a huge degree, but there seems to be enough incidents to say more then nothing happened (most of what happened: everyone tested subs and sub detection equipment in a closed loop).	1311980935

Yes, but that is not correct.  I have been a Libertarian and active in the Libertarian community since about 2005.  They've always hated Bush, and my brand of anarcho-capitalism ususally scares off more moderate libertarian miniarchists.  Your assumptions are completely baseless.  Then you said Rand Paul is the closest thing to a Libertarian elected last cycle, even though he does not self-identify as Libertarian and Libertarians do not consider him one of their own.  He may represent the libertarian wing of the Republican party, but thats about it.  He's still a Republican. \n\nEdit: And frankly, reddit used to be one of the freindliest places on the net for Libertarians, until Digg fell and there was a huge influx of unread political theorists who came rushing into /politics.  	1306185250
"How does it stand to reason that any video that follows the first must be faked? This mindset is completely alien to me. It's very simple logic: if I film you, then fake a second video of you, are you fake?"\n\nHow does your analogy come close to even applying If I am claiming the first video is fake but in your analogy you imply that it is necessarily real.  You talk of simple logic and then post that?\n\nA better analogy would be if you fake a video of me doing something (just as we know the first video of the Jerusalem event is fake) and then someone else posts a video of me doing the same exact thing, but from another angle.\n\nIf the second video is real, how did the first video get faked without ever seeing the second video before anyone else?  If they had access to the second video of me doing that why would they even fake the video in the first place.\n\n	1300797945

Yes, that is the latest piece of crap being debunked - if you actually cared to read about it you could have seen at the very top:\n\n&gt; *According to David Middleton, "Pat Michaels debunked this particular Warmist myth back in 2008".  **In reality, it was Patrick Michaels' article which was debunked - by Dennis Schmitt, the discoverer of Warming Island.  The rebuttal was given at the invitation of Andrew C. Revkin who posted it in this article.  It is in the nature of some people to ignore rebuttals and just keep churning out the same old 'not happening' and 'natural cycles' climate change myths as if there had never been any scientific evidence against them.**  This creates a need for ever stronger rebuttals, which we seek to establish here.*\n\nBut I guess that your [fear of Cognitive Dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) is stopping you from reading anything posted here - [a very good way to expose you as a 'fake skeptic'](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/kwgys/skeptics_did_i_miss_something_had_anyone_ever/c2ns2be)!	1317741780

Yes, of course, with the state of UFO study in America it's always possible that the Govt. is lying. But there's not a lot of evidence for it, and explanations like "they responded differently because it wasn't immediately apparent the object was, in fact, a downed balloon" tend to ring more true that sophisticated cover ups. I'm not saying that Mogul was definitely the identity of the object, I'm just saying its the most likely scenario, in my opinion, proposed thus far. Barring evidence, I can't jump to more grand conclusions.\n\nBut you're right. There are individual aspects of the story, changed over years, that have risen questions about how true it is. In general, though, those "holes" in the story have not been so substantial as to invalidate the stories.\n\nHell, it could have been a secret munitions experiment for all we know. But I wouldn't assume it was until I was shown the appropriate evidence.\n\nLike you, I'm no expert. I just want the realm of ufology taken seriously, so we need to be particularly vigilant about separating fact from hypothesis.	1302223420

Lo and behold, the source says:\n\n&gt;Bovine gas (the burps more so than the farts) is problematic because cattle, jolly cud-chewing ruminants that they are, digest their food through enteric fermentation, which emits **methane, a gas approximately 23 times better at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.**\n\nThat's right, the 23X number is a comparison between carbon dioxide and methane, not between corn-fed cows and grass-fed cows.  Now, either the author has a severe reading comprehension problem or is being purposefully disingenuous.  In fact, just read a little more in that same [source](http://www.grist.org/article/2009-05-21-on-cow-burps-meat-and-methane):\n\n&gt;What was surprising (at least to me) is that grazing, grass-fed cattle--those happy cows we all like to celebrate, and some of us (hi, Ed) like to eat--will, according to Eshel, emit **four to five more methane than corn-fed cattle.** *But wait -- that doesn't mean that you should reach for a CAFO burger.  "There are many reasons why grass-fed is superior," says Eshel. "I don't want anyone to think that greenhouse gas is the be-all and end-all. We have so many environmental problems."* 	1310532464

Actually, with some govt. run systems you have the options, with others you don't.\n\n&gt; Not with my money.\n\nPrivate insurers are doing it with your money, just like public insurers.\n\nYou can more or less choose your private insurer -- you have a point there.

What does statistics tell us? Do people tend to hang alone or in pairs? Why do they do the things they do? From what you are telling me, you do things that make you happy. \n\nAnd regarding choices... Not matter how big or small, you can always do a choice once. If I really want a chocolate shake after dinner today and get one, then I get chocolate shake after dinner today. If after one sip I change my mind and get a vanilla instead then I am not making the choice one more time, I am making a new choice. Point is that we can never know how life would have been with us taking the other choice. \n\nYou tell me, your wife and yourself that you would be perfectly (btw, careful with that word) happy if you had not decided to be with her, but that is extrapolation. It might have sucked as well.\n\nI have many happy memories from things I've done alone, but it does not come close to the amount of good memories together with someone. Be that with friends, unknowns, a dog or a significant other. It's not important that it's with a life long partner at its not always because of what others do. But for some reason most of the happy memories I have was together with others. I am not alone I this. \n\nThere is no guarantee that others would be much more happy all alone in the world. It could well be someone would love that. I think they would be abnormal compared to the average though.	1320756517

When would a demolition crew, who would have needed weeks of unrestricted access to the building and who also would have had to do a lot of welding/cutting of main columns, etc, have had the chance to do this in a building that was used on a daily basis by thousands of people without anyone noticing? The only time this could have been done is during the construction of the buildings, and if thats the case the dynamite would have had to be over 20 years old and would have never gone off. \n\nThe myth of the 'hyper-competent government' covers all aspects of the 9/11 shit, unless people really think G.W.Boosch was a genius super villain, the government could have never have pulled off and inside job on 9/11.

The idea isn't to stop using fossil fuels entirely, it is to continue transitioning away from them, towards renewables.\n\nThe problem with the economic argument against a reduction in the use of fossil fuels is that the calculated costs of inaction (both in economic and human terms) are much higher than those of mitigation.\n\nThe technology is already there, and keeps improving. We need to step up the transition and push for political action. Even China has indicated it would be willing to sign a binding agreement on emissions by 2020...it's not an impossible task, even if it's not going to be easy.	1353799848

I recall some guy from some bullshit anti-smoking/anti-drug propaganda organization doing that trick in high school where he had one of the largest football players hold his arm out and he pushed down. Then he made him hold a cigarette in his lips and did the same thing but different so he pushed down. He even repeated the second attempt and told him to resist harder but hold the cigarette in place. \n\nHaving smoked for about 6 years by the time I witnessed the presentation, I knew damn well that it was a trick and I was very tempted to challenge him but I was always the quiet and shy type (not to mention that I didn't want to announce in front of the whole school that I smoked heavily) so I just ignored it.	1309963462
I agree with a lot of your position, but I feel you are making your argument unnecessarily combative. \n\nConsider this: both over regulation and under regulation,  can be damaging, either economically, competitively,environmentally.\n\nIt can also lead to results the opposite if the intent behind the legislation.\n\nI am uncertain fracking is all that great or bad, but it is alleged to be responsible for methane (powerful greenhouse gas) release, that is not factored into the intent of carbon cost plans.\n\nIt looks to me like some energy companies see the current carbon economy climate as incentive to push into previously less viable fields (more expensive) and extraction technologies for gas over coal and oil.\n\nIt's clear that regulation and free markets are a complex beast.\n	1355529055

I don't like to side with Chopra's mumbo jumbo, however this isn't really the intent of his statement. What I gathered from his words is he meant using our imaginations, as it were, to visualize an image from memory. Yes we can see what a cat sees by reading those particular cells. The true question is when we imagine an image and visualize it does it stimulate our brains in the same- or similar manner. I don't know if that's ever been proven, although I wouldn't be surprised if there's some paper showing strong correlations.\n\nIt would also certainly depend on the subject's brain. Someone with synesthesia may have a much easier time creating imagery which they interpret as seeing. I only know of one case, but her imagination is quite vivid and she has told me visualizing to her is quite comparable to seeing. I am different: conjuring images, like the rose or my mother's face, is difficult for me. There are vague shapes and colours but nothing quite so clear and representative as others have described to me.	1340001836

People do have different learning styles. However, the theories regarding these styles, how they relate, what causes them, and how best to accommodate them as an educator--should be considered educated suggestions more than they should be considered scientifically sound.\n\nResearch shows that students learn more, and retain longer, when the information is presented in a variety of formats. There are a few good reasons why this is true, regardless of learning styles.\n\n	1254528862

Hey, there. I have several similar experiences,  one of them happened exactly 2 years ago. I was visiting my mom in Bosnia and stayed in our house. I was out with my cousin to the local bar and had 5 Heinis (these are the little bottles of Heineken pipi/girl beer). I admit I was slightly drunk/tipsy. Anyways I get home, my mom is already asleep and I go to the first floor where my room is, get ready for bed and lay down. Just a year ago we had central heating installed, so back then it was wood ovens for heating. I usually didnt touch it, because I have no clue about making fires... \n\nIt was not unusual that late at night my mom would come upstairs and add some more wood to the fire. So I lay down, tipsy ditsy and start to doze away, laying on my left side with my face toward the door of the room.\nRight next to it, to the left is the heating oven.  I hear the door opening and someone coming in. I'm not paying attention, thinking it would be my mom adding to the fire... Well, it wasn't my mom. 'It' closes the door and moves past the oven and stands on the other end of my bed, watching over me. I notice and want to turn around but I can't move. I want to say something, I am scared but only mumbling comes out of me. I couldn't turn nor scream... I feel it watches me and I don't know why, initially I was scared shitless but pretty quickly I calm down and fall into a very deep sleep. \n\nThe next morning, remembering what happened, I would ask my mom if she came upstairs to add wood, but she said she didn't. \n\nI know what it was or better, who it was. My dad died in the house in 2005. He had two strokes in 2000 and since then had Alzheimers and Dementia. Five years later he died from a lung pneumonia that was discovered too late. \n\nWhen I was a kid he used to come into my room, when I was about to go to sleep, to tell me not to have my knees bent otherwise I wouldn't grow any taller (actually I stayed pretty short) and then he would tuck me into my blanket and leave and I would fall asleep.\n\nI took great comfort in hoping/knowing that it was him who came bye to look after me. To see if I would have grown any taller maybe. I was looking for signs from him ever since he died and there it was. Or maybe I was just drunk... \n	1356735588

And I asked him for his evidence that I was wrong and got nothing, and it was obvious early on oftheblah was completely convinced witchcraft wasn't real and his beliefs were deep seated only in science, and at that point I realized that the debate was a dead end because even if God came down from heaven and shook his hand he would say it isn't real because Neil Degrasse said so or because it wasn't in his science text book, and It's obvious you're the same way,that's why you're holding a torch for oftheblah or you're him using a throwaway. btw why did I have to explain myself again? wasn't all this obvious enough for you to see in the original comments or are you trolling me too? 	1335610884

Reminds me of story Green-light. An atheist liberal pacifist democrat evolutionist muslim feminist socialist gay jew communist catholic unionist abortionist professor (and a member of the ACLU and NAACP) was bitching at a college class and she told the class that she was a strong independent menstruating womyn and she was going to prove that there is no GOD (peace be upon him). She screamed, “GAWD, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform. I’ll give you 15 human minutes, and I’m glad all those people died on 9/11! Also all men are rapists and I have abortions for fun.”\n\nTen earthling minutes went by. She kept taunting God (peace be upon him), saying, “Here I am, GAWD, if that is your real name. I’m still waiting. Is my strong, powerful, and financially independent vagina too much for your patriarchy? You stupid man!”\n\nShe got down to the last couple of minutes and a brave, patriotic, pro-life marine just returned from the War of Independence and honorably discharged and newly registered in every class backflipped up to the professor, hit her full force in the face with a spinning flying drop kick (with metal as fuck jet-boots on), and sent her flying from her platform through two panes of glass, two twin towers, a pile of cans, a young mother pushing a baby carriage, a nun and a pile of boxes. The professor struggled up, obviously shaken, with three broken legs, two broken arms, a broken jaw, a broken skull, 12 broken ribs, internal bleeding and a missing spine. She bitched, “What’s the matter with you? Why did you do that? Are you afraid of a strong beautiful black womyn? You stupid Christian, I only worship my vagina!”\n\nThat marine replied, “GOD (peace be upon him) was busy watching over MY buddies engaged in combat in the coke wars (Never forget). So… he… sent… ME!”\n\nThe professor cried a single tear and said “I was wrong to want equal rights for homosexuals, women and minorities. Barry Hussain Osama is a Muslim socialist atheist and he hates America. I am now pro-life, pro-guns, and pro-capital punishment”. The professor then burnt her copy of Origin of the Species, shaved her legs, put her bra back on, and started to make the marine a sandwich. “If Trayvon Martin didn’t want to die he should not have been wearing a hoodie!”\n\n“Welcome to the Republican Party” Said the Marine.\n\nThe students applauded and all registered with the Republican party that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag (where it shed a single tear).\n\nThat professor was Richard Elizabeth Dawkins. That college class was The Beatles. That young mother was Sarah Palin. That nun was Michele Bachmann. That eagle was Ron Paul. That marine’s name? Albert Einstein.	1355540636

Most of these claims about alleged golden ratio relationships and golden spirals in nature are spurious, or simply outright false.\n\nThese pages debunk and discuss some of the more common claims:\n\n* [Fibonacci Flim-Flam](http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm)\n* [The Myth That Will Not Go Away](http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_05_07.html)\n\nIf you're looking for something more in-depth, Mario Livio's book [_The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number_](http://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C) is a highly recommended read: it covers all the things that make the golden ratio legitimately interesting, alongside debunking all the things that don't.	1338295300

In France, a [guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_All%C3%A8gre), a scientist (also former politician, and former minister -*not* the religious kind), was a loud denier, so the science academy was asked to issue a final opinion on the issue to settle it. And their conclusion was : there is no doubt that climate is changing, that the cause of the change is most likely mankind, and that shit is about to hit the fan.\n\nAnd for my opinion on the whole thing, yes, it's quite real, no, nothing will happen.

&gt; Studies have to be paid for. So, find out who is paying for the study.\n\n&gt; The person doing the study, what do they do for a living ? If they are a politician, what are their leanings ? If they are a uni researcher, what is the gist of the their main body of work ?\n\nI'm sorry, but I think this is **very** bad advice. I would have had no problem if you said: If there are flaws in a study you could, if you like, try to look at these things to find a motive. But it doesn't work the other way round and in my personal opinion is the reason for a lot of this conspiracy bullshit (a study financed by a pharmaceutical company where it concludes that a product made by this company works as intended is automatically disqualified - that's not how science works).\n\n&gt; The information itself. Is it scientifically sound ? Is it reproducible ? Is the sample size big enough ? Is it representative ? Is there a control group (if the study warrants).\n\nThe problem I have with this is, that it is getting next to impossible to be at a level to judge these things in all sciences. You are fooling yourself if you think you can look at every study or every paper and form an opinion on it.\n\nI hate to say it, but for the most part we have to rely on experts. We have to rely on scientists in the field who know what they're talking about. And you have to trust the other scientists that they will speak out if someone in their field is bullshitting the public (and they do that - just look at the NASA study on arsenic-based life forms or the cloning scandal in Japan a few years ago).	1343657918

Most of it. I can only really speak to the topic of yoga though. Yoga merely means to yoke oneself to God. There have been hundreds of forms of yoga over the centuries. For many of those forms, including the modern form, the most important aspect of the practice is breath control. Believe it or not, stretching is considered very much secondary to breathing. Diet can also be a huge part of yoga. Hell, sex can be a huge part of yoga. You can't do those last parts of yoga in a classroom. The author qualifies all this by saying "yoga as we know it today." Well, which of the hundreds of forms of yoga? What about the ones which are nothing like what we would consider to be yoga? There is no one form of yoga. There are hundreds of forms of yoga. The article is nonsense. It's a poorly constructed argument, and it's poorly researched. \n\nI'd tend to agree that Aton LaVey invented Satanism. Also, I always thought that the Ouija board started as a board game, or a parlour game. Do people honestly believe otherwise? I don't know.

I had to do the same thing. My son had blood in his stool, and when there wasn't, it was green and runny (it's supposed to be yellow and kind-of oatmeal-like). When I took him to the doctor's, he told me to go easy on the dairy products. Within a couple of weeks of eliminating dairy products, his issues were solved. His little rash also went away, and he also didn't cry half as much anymore.  \n\nI stayed off dairies for about 18 months and my son still has some issues when he eats too much dairy products.	1346076846

Because it's interesting to note that Sagan's opinion on the subject isn't as clear cut as skeptics would like to believe. It's also *very* noteworthy that his recommendation was that the phenomenon is worthy of further study. Not that it was bunk and everyone should go home, but instead continue to gather data in hopes of formulating a solid conclusion based on *science.*\n\nI'd be willing to bet that most people didn't know he testified in a [1968 Congressional hearing](http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1987.htm) on the matter. 	1331941294

Honestly, I think stuff like this gets written by people who feel a need to prove themselves intellectually, but aren't actually intellectual.\n\nThey probably have some deep psychological issue and have been bowled over in the past and really impressed by people who *sound* smart. Whether or not the speaker actually was smart, or the listener even grasped the topic being discussed.\n\nSimilarly, they probably want other people to be as impressed by them.\n\nUnfortunately, they aren't of an intelligent mindset. By giving off these type of words (construct, geometrical, conscious primal currents) they give the illusion that they are talking about well-defined "scientific" ideas and have a firm grasp of the concepts. It's kind of a cop-out. Goal achieved, no work necessary.\n\nIt's pathetic.\n\n**TLDR** Really they're just spewing words to give the illusion of intelligence.	1289319541

Last July I was camping high in the Appalachian mountains along the Kentucky-West Virginia border. At about 4 am I had to take a shit, so I walk about 200 yards across the clearing just inside the treeline. As I'm relieving myself in the pitch black I notice that all the insects and frogs down by the creek fell silent. Then I start to hear these really heavy footsteps. They get closer and closer and then they stop. Whatever it was stopped about 20-30 feet away from me and started grunting, whooping and throwing rocks. So I shined my flashlight in the direction of the sounds and rock throwing and all I see is two huge red eyes about 9 feet up in the trees and a flash of reddish-brown fur. When I shined my light whatever it was took off howling. I went back when it was light out and found some 16 or 17 inch tracks, snapped tree branches (12 feet off the ground), and the grapefruit sized stones near my shit-hole. I packed up camp and got the fuck out of there. I don't think I've ever been that terrified in my life. \n\ntl;dr I think I saw a Bigfoot while I was shitting in the woods last summer.	1336069675

I am a scientist and not involved in the paranormal in any way, spare the fact that I find it interesting from a mythology standpoint. \nThat being said, when I was going through puberty light bulbs would burn out or flicker, cups would fly of counter-tops, and once a crystal bowl exploded. I looked into it, then, and many of the explanations I found dealt with "poltergeist" activity-- the notion that one's own internal conflicts are becoming manifested through manipulating the outside world subconsciously/telekinetically (sp?). \nNow...THAT having been said, what I really there are natural explanations for all these things, even if they aren't readily apparent. For example, replacing the wall clocks' batteries from the same faulty batch or the change in atmospheric moisture content and temperature leading to more resistance within the lighting fixtures COULD account for what you're describing. As for me, a draft can knock over a stack of cups and a rapidly cooling crystal bowl can explode (as it was just taken out of the dishwasher). IMHO\nTL;DR: There are likely natural explanations for what you are describing, but when we're worked up b/c of the day-to-day stuff, it all seems more overwhelming and somehow connected. \n	1317261479

I have seen those shadows that you speak off.

I have no control over up or downvotes, but i'm not in argument with you.

Sure it is. In the US, we've replaced use of that term with the phrase "African-American", because it was considered offensive.

I've heard some convincing arguments that de-leading gasoline and access to abortion are the two reasons that the crime rate plummeted late in the 20th century.\n\nIt's awfully hard to prove this sort of thing, though.\n\n-- edit,\n\nSpecifically, airborne lead generally lowered the cognitive functions of people and raised neurological disorders including lower control of impulses.  One of the effects was increased likelihood of committing a crime.

Ok, we can have a discussion, but only if you stop with the victimization bullshit.  You're not being downvoted because you blasphemed against our god of modern medicine.  Your initial comment strongly implied that we only differentiate medicine from alternative medicine based on what pharmaceutical companies decide to produce.  *That* is why you were downvoted.  You did not say anything profound or challenging or about healthy skepticism.\n\n\nNow.\n\n&gt;Are you going to have a doctor say "you should eat two cloves of garlic a day"?\n\nA doctor recommending that you alter your diet is not at all unusual, but that is not alternative medicine.  That is just normal nutritional advice.  Eating garlic to promote health or avoid a certain condition is fine.  But that is not the same as claiming garlic is an alternative to a tested medicine as a cure for a specific disease.  People learned to eat citrus fruits to avoid scurvy.  The medical test would be if someone did a proper double blind study to show that the rate of scurvy is much lower or eliminated in the group eating the fruit.  It's not medicine, it's nutrition.  Knowing what is and is not healthy to eat also requires the scientific method.  That is only one claim.  Eating citrus fruits reduces or eliminates your risk of scurvy.  If you want to claim that they also protect against the flu, then you need another study to test that claim.  And if you say it will cure you once you've been infected, then it is being claimed as a medicine and that claim also needs to be tested.\n\n\nSo, 2 questions:\n\nWhat are the proposed benefits of garlic?\n\nWhat studies do you have to support each specific claim?\n\n\n&gt;Labeling a field as categorically stupid and employing stereotypes as justification is completely against the idea of skepticism.\n\nHow exactly did I use a stereotype as justification for anything?	1319761387

As have I. The only issue I take with that episode is that when you drink too much, you "just have to stop drinking" (or something to that effect).

what you encountered is known in physics as a [closed time-like curve.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve) basically, you enter an area of spacetime that is so warped that you end up traveling back in time to the exact point in which you entered the curve. since you immediately start at the curved point in spacetime, there is (theoretically) no way to escape such loops. you continue travelling faster and faster through the curve until eventually you reach the speed of light. \n\nobviously, you found a way out of the loop, so good for you! you broke physics.	1346041501

Someones dreaming here. Let me provide seven reasons why Disclosure will never happen.\n\n1. We are barking up the wrong tree. The govt is no longer in possession of the info we`re pushing to get disclosed. The US govt itself is a false construct, a fake choice of two parties that act as one entity, designed to make us believe that somewhere there is a civilized structure to society that looks out for the better interests of the public, when in reality, the govt does little more than provide laws and protections for the corporations in the hopes that the success of those corporations provides the security and needs of the people, that the govt claims to be responsible for. Unfortunately the corporate psychology has no such intent, unless it feeds their bottom line. Disclosure doesnt feed that bottom line,...therefore there is no real impetous to acheive it.\n\n\n2. The majority of the historical documentation &amp; info that the govt may have had, has long since been purged. When we have former heads of the CIA like Bush Sr, who, when asked about what the govt knows about the UFO subject, was cryptically quoted as saying, "You don't know the half of it,...(/sinister grin)". Do you really think someone like Bush Sr., who has an enourmous sense of entitlement, the position of power, and belief that the info would have serious reprocussions on his society, wouldnt destroy as much of that info as possible to maintain plausible deniability? I maintain that info simply no longer exists. I know that's what I would do with a secret that I believed was too dangerous to risk leaking.\n\n\n3. Physical evidence has been deligated to privatized industry. Any resources(tech, info or biological), from crashes or theoretical tech exchanges, has been firmly locked up &amp; diseminated over so many tech generations, in black budget shell companies, such that there is no longer any clear indication of where that resource originated from. Furthermore, a privitized company has no obligation to reveal any of that info. Make no mistake on the issue; even sighting reports now being deligated to the privatized domain,...(brilliant move imo). How can we expect to get disclosure from a corporation that has no interest in sharing the resources that the govt has provided them for research &amp; development. May as well ask Batelle to tell us where the inspiration for Nitinol came from,...\n\n\n4. We've already lost alot of the 'old time' witnesses to the original crimes. The US govt made the clear &amp; informed decision to keep the subject from the public back in the 50s(perhaps earlier). I'm sure the continued delaying actions on disclosure come from hoping they can put it off indefinately, or at least, ideally, until there is no one left from that era to hold directly responsible. 25 year NDAs help, and the testimony from such dated sources have a very limited impact, as witnessed by the lack of MSM coverage of the UFOs &amp; Nukes disclosure last week.\n \n\n5. Disinformation will keep the boat a rockin until it sinks. The Ufological community is, at best, in disarray. There are too many cooks pulling in too many directions to ever get anywhere. People like Greer, Project Cameltoe, Maussan, Icke and Hoagland, are doing far more damage(perhaps purposefully in some cases), than convincing people to take a serious look at the subject in an objective manner. The fact that people still flock to these disinfo mongers and charlatans tells me(and perhaps the powers that be) that we are indeed still gullible sheep, and that there really is no need for disclosure until we stop believing every pile of BS lobbed at us no matter how high or steaming it is, or how much it stinks. The truth may be every bit as unbelievable as the lies, but why stop now if the lies are still working,...?\n\n\n6. MSM is tied to the corporatocracy directly. NWO theories aside, there are only a handful of media conglomerates on the planet and they all have to deal with respective govt bodies. While UFO stories may serve to attract customers, and perhaps make the sheople feel like the issue is moving forward, this is still playing the delay game, and we swallow it over and over,... If MSM really considered UFOs a news story, there would be followups on every UFO sighting reported instead of a 3min segment and the end of the broadcast for filler. MSM has no time to reveal hoaxes or report on genuine unknowns in followups, it doesnt feed their bottom line. They have no real interest in revealing info that could bring down their religious institutions, law makers and greatest advocates, bring them embarassment, resentment or reveal them as outright liars. All of this would shake the status quo one way or another &amp; that's not their job; their job is to make money.\n\n\n7. The govt has no definative answers. Disclosure already has happened. It's just burried in that same mound of BS, like the 2001 Disclosure movement; it's up to you to decide what's real and what isn't, but the govt has already had all their secrets spilled by someone at sometime. Good luck getting any further clarification of the facts from the people who want to maintain plausible deniability,...\n\n\nOn the other hand, France had disclosure long ago with the Cometa report,...wake up people, I'm not sure what your expecting here but you're sure to be disappointed if you can't see the truth has already been revealed; albeit amidst a heaping, steaming pile of BS,...	1286135888
&gt; I don't think this is by any means analogous. If me not wearing a helmet could cause you harm, then it might work.\n\nWhy are you talking about other people all of a sudden? You said:\n\n&gt; its a "better safe than sorry" precaution\n\nIt would also be safer to wear a helmet while driving a car. Why don't you do that?

Again, you're absolutely right. The problem is, to ever begin to explain anything you need a hypothesis, an educated guess that in some ways assumes things that are presently not fact. Often the people who make the biggest leaps in science make some outrageous claims through educated guessing mixed with observation, then testing.\n\nYou may not like the concept of science doesn't know everything but it's the truth. Science *can* explain everything but presently doesn't. Until then we make educated guesses, observe and test.	1282447375

From the article:\n&gt;*Was it a meteor? He’d heard there was a green meteor shower taking place from 6 to 9 p.m. that evening — **but no way was it supposed to show up in the earth’s atmosphere**.*\n\nThe article makes my brain hurt.  The author tosses the meteorite argument out completely by saying that "no way was it supposed ot show up in the earth's atmosphere."  This completely ignores the sole ingredient of a meteor shower, namely meteors burning up in the earth's atmosphere.  Just like what appears to be happening in the very poor quality picture.\n\nOn top of that the author's allusion to the "father of three and his 10 y.o. daughter" seems to be a backhanded way of discounting any questions of credibility.  I offer this [wiki article involving a father and his children and a hoax...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_boy_hoax) as food for thought.   Sorry but the source needs either vetting or corroboration - the author offers none.	1301969624

\nThe vaccine has a limited duration.  Your immunity fades over time, so a vaccination for a disease you receive at 5 (or whatever) will be protecting you in your childhood, but is weaker by the time adulthood rolls around (I was finishing high school).  \n\nThe doctor was being tongue-in-cheek.  The whole idea behind inoculation in the first place is that your immune system can prevent you from coming down with diseases you've already had. The principle behind many vaccines is the idea of giving you a "killed" virus that your body can form antibodies to, but won't result in full-blown disease.  \n\nIf someone contracts the disease, they'll eventually have similar immunity, but this isn't necessarily as helpful as being vaccinated from a herd standpoint.  If they contracted it, they're producing and spreading the virus while they're ill.  For instance, the exchange student spreading the virus resulted in several of us contracting pertussis and missing months of school.  \n\nHowever, the few of us that got sick before this was clamped down on were all older high school students.  For the purposes of a respiratory illness, we were practically adults.  Less healthy targets could wind up dead (and many in the world do).  Even if you don't die, pertussis can last about three months.  There's also secondary issues that can be caused by having it, rib fractures, and so on (if death weren't enough).	1327324381

&gt;No, it is the process of genetic manipulation itself which damages the plant\n\nThis is pretty baseless. There are also many possible processes for genetic manipulation. \n\n&gt;They all suffered from a process that damages the genome.\n\nThis is highly subjective. With the infinite number The number of possible changes is essentially infinite. To say that anything would be "damage" is rather absurd.\n\nBasically any possible problem is an engineering problem that depends very much on the specifics of the modifications.\n\n	1279826599

If I believed there was a God who was judging my life and would decide if I spent eternity in heaven or hell, I would damn well be thinking about Him every single minute of every single day. I would devote my life to him.\n\nAll those so called Christians who just see God as a hot water bottle for a little bit of comfort and who spend most of their lives doing "more important things" aren't very serious about their religion. Their lack of devotion to something that they putatively claim is so important makes me doubt that they believe any of it really.	1338914152

I'm glad skeptic weighted in on this, I voted no, despite many of my peers urging a yes from everyone. I came to a no vote with doing a ton of research -- I found not only is GMO safe, the testing they do on the crops are insane -- more testing than, say, what the meat industry does to test for disease.\n\nAn article called GMO "the climate denial of the left". I think I agree. And this article states it bluntly; it's hatred for a multinational. Sure, Monsanto is shitty. But these scientists -- they work hard. And Monsanto, at the end of the day, is still a company. They aren't going to risk putting out a crop that has an allergen and lose a ton of business. The fact is GMOs are safe and the crops Monsanto provides seeds for thrive -- and the yes voters just infurating, somehow.\n\nBetter idea: this movement has legs. Start a regulatory commission that can test if something is GMO-free, everyone kick in a few sheckles to pay for this non-profit. Your organic grocier will eat up this label. And it doesn't depend on the government regulating it.\n\nIt's so perfect it already exists.	1352478485

Holy crap, someone on the Internet admitted he was mistaken!  Well, I guess it would be in /r/skeptic of all places.\n\n&gt; The term "ambient" means something akin to "from the environment" .... therefore, not man-made.\n\nEh, as a photographer to clarify a little we'd still call it "ambient" if it's man-made.  It just has to be a part of the environment such as the lights that are usually in the ceiling of a building or the street lamps along the road.  If you bring a light specifically for the purpose of shooting a portrait or something (or in this case see a "psychic orb" emitting its own light) then we're not talking ambient anymore.	1345139202

On the contrary, I think it simplifies the issue. When you say you're an agnostic atheist you're stating you don't know but don't personally believe. That's a clear starting point for further discussion about the nuances in your position. \n\nSimply saying "I'm an agnostic" doesn't really say much about belief and, honestly, it's only now being used by atheists who don't like to call themselves atheists because they think it has negative connotations or (and I see this more often) people who want to feel intellectually superior to both theists and atheists by sitting on the fence pretending there's no dichotomy. 	1308115242

I feel it is called magic so that a persons belief can be swayed in a different way. I think that when a young person is shown something, and told that it is magic, that person can hold it close with their true beliefs as something very special.\nTelling a young person that these abilities are really them picking out subtle non verbal clues could perhaps not hold the same special importance in belief structure as "magic".\n	1345000765

&gt;If you show me any studies suggesting that we can focus on one aspect without any other processes interfering, please let me know.\n\nI am suggesting the opposite. We cannot focus on one sense and disregard other senses. However we can still focus on a certain memory or emotion, even with other processes "interfering". I seriously don't see how is this even an issue for discussion. If you can't even focus on an issue or emotion, how can you do any form of therapy at all. In fact, how do you even manage daily living? \n\nThis is what was taught by the founder of EFT Gary Craig and what I practice for myself and with my clients.

&gt;No need to apologize, I was looking forward to a point by point reply :)\n&gt;\n&gt;But because of your need to apologize, I'm assuming it might be a reflection on how you think about these long responses so now I feel the need to apologize.. sorry about the length!\n\nAh, I was more concerned about you and other readers (though by now there are probably not many still reading this). Personally, I'm happy with long replies.\n\n&gt;It's true, there are a lot of unknowns, but on the other hand, there is also a lot of data pointing a certain way. And let's not forget the learning experience, it would be a huge opportunity whether it succeeds or not to put some theories (as theoretical as the theory of evolution or gravity) about human behavior to the test.\n\nYep, that was what I meant in my previous reply about an experiment - how do you do an experiment like this? You would need complete buy-in (so to speak) of all the individuals in the experiment area, and also to prevent people from outside the experiment area from taking advantage. So you would need to basically have a large commune to do it, and to prevent selection bias (most of those who take part would already have bought into the system), it would need to be populated by people that already live in the area. And it would need to run for decades. You would also need to have a contingency plan for failure, since you would need to revert to a currency-based economy, and there would no longer be any traditional businesses in the area to employ people, so it would probably take decades just to return it to something like it was previously.\n\nAlso, if it's an experiment of an RBE and not just a sociological experiment, you need to be able to ensure that all the resources you need are in the area - some resources are currently hoarded by certain countries (returning to helium, the US holds the vast majority of the worlds limited resource, and it's required for coolant for things like MRI scanners). Having to ship in resources may upset the economic part of the experiment.\n\nSo, it'd be a very difficult experiment to do, and I'm not sure many leaders will want to risk their political careers to implement it.\n\n&gt;So with that in mind, it's not about if it is possible to turn around people today (though that could work for the most part I assume, and we're already doing this by exposing people to this information) but it's generational thing, the education and environment of the children (think of the children! :)).\n\n:)\n\nYep, I agree - if it works at all, it'd likely take centuries. Not that it's a reason not to do it, I'm sure we both agree that just because you'll never see the pay-off doesn't mean it's not worth doing it for future generations (though not everyone will see it that way).\n\n&gt;I have met a surprisingly growing number of people that tell me that our system will eventually change itself to a RBE, and that there is no real need for what TZM does.\n\nYou mean spontaneously, without anyone actively working towards it? Interesting - how so?\n\n&gt;But to answer more specifically, education can change people so they live a life free of waste (or keep it in mind and motivate them to do something about it) and share resources instead of hoarding them. Education would make it clear to them that it is in their personal interest to behave that way. And what benefits them (a more clean, healthy environment, less crime) benefits others automatically.\n\nYep, education would work to a certain degree, but what we'd need to change is the consumerist attitudes I referred to previously - people would need to be convinced that they don't necessarily need the latest and greatest things, and to use resources responsibly. Would we be able to change attitudes to the extent that, when it comes time for currency to be abolished, there's very few who will act as people generally do now?\n\n&gt; It's all about intelligent management. There are today already alternatives to certain resources, and I don't mean exact replacements, we might have to do with less so we can do more. And I'll exaggerate with my example but you'll get the point, maybe instead of a solid gold chain you could have a gold plated chain (with comparable weight/feel). Not that people would actually want a gold chain in a RBE, this is just an exaggeration :)\n\nWell, I don't have any jewellery at all (I've never seen the point), but yes, I see what you mean :)\n\nBut at the same time, it's hard to tell if alternatives can be found for all the resources we need (as opposed to want) in the future. Different elements and compounds have different properties, and an application may only ever be able to use that particular one - such with MRI scanners, as I mentioned for helium above.\n\n(Yes, helium is scarce, but it's also cheap, so instead of helping to save lives it gets wasted on party balloons, and hardly anyone realises the implications. Sad, isn't it?)\n\nBut anyway, these will run out whether we stick with a CBE or switch to an RBE, as we agreed, so there's little real debate between us here.\n\n&gt;I get this. And I wonder how that experiment would've looked if there was no money involved and equal access. Those are 2 components that have a very big impact on any system. Would it have failed as much? Would it have failed at all? I don't know, but it's food for thought.\n\nGood question, I wonder that myself, and I'm not sure that we can really ever know. But that's not to compare communism and an RBE - they're both socio-economic and political models, but they differ in many ways.\n\n&gt;I agree completely. And you might have already distilled my view on this, it's not because we don't know the outcome beforehand that we shouldn't at least try it. Eyes on the prize, and its a very attractive prize (world peace, comfortable lives, equal opportunities, no slavery (payed/unpayed) or prostitution (of any kind)).\n\nWell, I can't argue that it's a great prize if it works out. But the risks of failure need to be taken into account as well. I'm not so sure that it's as simple as going ahead and trying it, I think we need more evidence of its feasibility and to put measures in place to recover a CBE (in some form) if it fails, before we go ahead and do it.\n\n&gt;Unless it costs more to do a complete recovery :) If you can't make any money by solving the problem, why solve it? That's the profit motive for ya ;)\n\nPoint taken :)\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if it's possible to completely recover more (or indeed, all) of the material, not being in that industry.\n\n&gt;True, it might make things more complex if you have to also keep in mind the recycling part of a product. But if we're not living in a system where you only have a certain budget/time (to market, being faster than your competitor) for R&amp;D and need to cut corners to make it, things will look very different.\n\nYes, but what I mean is, while part of the reason things are designed the way they are is because of time and budgeting constraints, part of it is also because they need to be designed that way or they wouldn't work at all. You can design things better to allow more of them to be recycled, but there's a limit.\n\n&gt;Also, in a RBE, collaboration would be to the benefit of this facet of product design. Instead of having thousands of different corporations with their own R&amp;D and patents, having a world collaboration of all those minds.. imagine the possibilities, it's easy to see the potential benefit(s) in this.. like for example the learning opportunities!\n\nTrue, collaboration would be beneficial, and it would be good not to have to worry about who's going to rip off your IP (as a creator of IP, I'd *really* like that). But we need to be careful not to let that thought blind us - we'd need to consider everything before steaming ahead.	1317844853

Apparently in order for you to take my objections seriously here, I'm going to have read *Discourse* to see for myself what the difference between that and *Meditations* is.\n\nBut Meditations is still very much one of Descartes' influential works, and it still very much reflects what his philosophy his.  And in *Meditations,* he **does** argue for the existence of God using ontological arguments, and he **does** claim that the existence of God is the way that we can consider reality to be true and break free from the Skeptical position.  You cannot separate the views expressed in *Meditations* from the views expressed in *Discourse* that easily.\n\nYou do realize that Empiricism is considered to be one of the philosophical underpinnings of the scientific method, right?\n\nAnd your claim about the universe is that it is impossible to create something without external rules is why that video is a sufficient rebuttal: because it provides a possible explanation for how the universe could have come about from nothing, without requiring external rules to create it.\n\nYour claim was that it is impossible, the video refutes that.  The fact that it ends with an admission of not knowing is irrelevant, because of course we don't know for certain.  We can't know for certain.  But mathematically and physically, there is no reason it is not impossible.\n\n(Of course, I've failed to mention so far the obvious ludicrousness of the universe requiring something to be exist first in order for the universe to have been created.  What created the previously existing thing?  What created whatever created that?  And so on up to infinity.  Eventually you have to reach something that was not created, or you have an infinite chain of creation that itself was not created by anything.  In either case, why assume that our universe was created, instead of being something which did not require creation?)	1355430952

The obnoxious behaviors we associate with A+ existed before A+ formally assembled.  The Skepchick community has been rife with it for a long time.  The reason some people, who could rightfully be called bullies (or just dicks) have been picking on "Surly Amy" is because of these behaviors.\n\nYay, Amy has worked to send people to TAM in the past.  That is great, but that doesn't make her immune from criticism.  FFS, the cliquey Skepchick crowd has been saying awful things about the "old white men" that have worked their asses off for decades, but as soon as someone hurts one of their little feelings by criticizing their tendency to act like victims, they go down like a Brazilian soccer player.  It's just more of this deplorable shit:\nhttp://puu.sh/148rI\n\nI haven't heard anyone say that they don't want people from all areas of the spectrum to take part in the atheist community.  What people are decrying is that this sub-set seems more interested in establishing themselves as victims first, and demanding up front that they be treated as a protected class.  It's fucking obnoxious.  When Eugenie Scott goes up on stage and presents, I do not have any thoughts about her gender.  At all.  It only became an issue in my head when Rebecca Watson started issuing Fatwas against casual flirting because she was personally tired of the attention she had been getting - attention which she had in the past appeared to take in stride and even enjoy.\n\nOh, there I go again, "blaming the victim".	1347379367

I can't help but wonder if the patients in the study thought the researchers were lying to them. Scientific studies have a history of deception that even most laymen are aware of. So I don't think the people in the study were 100% sure it was a placebo. I don't know how I would control for that though. It would have been interesting to compare the effects of knowing it was a placebo versus not knowing.\n\nAlso,\n\n&gt;Nope, it still works.\n\nFrom the actual study:\n\n&gt;Conclusion\n\n&gt;Placebos administered without deception may be an effective treatment for IBS. Further research is warranted in IBS, and perhaps other conditions, to elucidate whether physicians can benefit patients using placebos consistent with informed consent.\n\nNot as unequivocal. There were only 80 patients, after all. I'm going to remain skeptical of this claim for now.	1344041590

Yes, it is true that placebos vary in efficacy based on a large number of variables (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Expectancy_and_conditioning).

Well, I for one love and embrace science. Anyone with a sense of wonder should realize that science is one of the greatest developments of our species. Technology allows us to grapple with our environment, but science allows us to broaden the scope of our awareness, allowing us to create new technologies. \n\nTo discredit it because it doesn't play nice with our worldview is to stagnate intellectually. \n\nBut by the same token, when people begin to treat science as ideology - another world-view - they tend to defend it with the same vehemence that others defend religious beliefs. The scientific consensus becomes irrefutable fact, holy writ. \n\nIn reality, you look at even our most fundamental theories like the Big Bang, and a lot of what we know is based on conjecture. There's a plethora of observable evidence that directly contradicts the big bang, though it remains our best explanation for how the universe came to be. Theories like Inflation arise to answer some of these anomalies, but there's not mechanical explanation for why the universe would suddenly expand more rapidly and then slow again - all we know is that for the big bang to have produced the universe we see, it must have happened. \n\nThe point is, science is in flux. It's constantly open to re-interpretation, and that's a good thing. It means the more we learn, the more opportunities we have to learn.	1353780271

I'm sorry if the way I came across in text seemed angry or argumentative.\n\nI have nearly three years of study in psychology and sociology. I'm not by any means an expert, but I *have* looked at the literature. This Münchausen by Internet is, in fact, a disorder, just as the other disorders I've mentioned. Yes, they are faking various illnesses, for reasons such as getting attention or sympathy. That is, in itself, a psychological disorder. So no, I'm not wrong. A person who functions "normally" in society does NOT create illnesses - a person who has a psychological problem does. Münchausen and Münchausen by Proxy are both also disorders. If you looked at the literature regarding Münchausen itself, and related issues, you'd have seen that.\n\nSorry for engaging in discussion with you.	1337859538

Basically those people are serial killer psychopaths and just use their belief for justification. \n\nThen I read this in Wikipedia:\n\n&gt; ... in recent years, 2,500 women accused of witchcraft were murdered by stoning, hanging and beheading by neighbours. \n\n:-(	1325498087

If I had a shit-ton of money, what I would do is make a camera especially for UFO's. Here's how it would work.\n\nUser would set up the camera on a tripod. Camera would have a computer in it, or maybe an Android device, Raspberry Pi -- whatever. You'd point the camera in the general direction and the computer would try to target that. A laser would help it target, and would also try to determine distance. (I guess it would need *two* lasers then).\n\nThe camera would have infrared, and be very light-sensitive. I don't know much about cameras, but that's what I would do. \n\nYour video is not nearly as bad as you think it is. I can stabilize it, but I'll need a few hours. If I have to do any real work today, it will wait till the weekend.	1352381297

1. Why does government have to spend money? Why can't we just let people spend money on what they want  to buy? There is no reason why the govt needs to invest in R&amp;D, companies are already free to research new technologies. If they lack the capital, they can go to banks, investment firms or companies that would be interested in a partnership etc and apply for a loan or some other agreement to develop their technology. This ensures that the loans are only given out to people and ideas with potential and if it fails it's their loss, not the government's loss. My argument is that millions of brains of private people and companies are better at reading the market and producing what people want than the government, to argue otherwise is to suggest that central planning (aka socialism) is the ideal.\n\n2. Yep! The US Dollar is currently the reserve currency which is a huge benefit and arguably will not last. Watch the US's credit rating drop as the world realises that the US cannot pay their debts just like Greece.\n\n3. Got anything to back this up? Any tax given back can be used for people to get out of debt or spend buying things. Why is that a bad investment?\n\n4. Yes they are. You think if we imposed a tax on say all fast food, that the fast food restaurants will just shrug and let the tax eat into the entirety of their profits? You would see a number of different things. A) Fast food places putting their prices up to cover the extra cost. B) Fast food places reducing the quality of their food even further to cut costs. C) Fast food places shutting down because they can't turn a profit anymore, why bother operating?\nThis is just an hypothetical example but you can see how it would increase the price of burgers, make them crappier and also reduce the availability of them. Directly influencing consumers.\nA increase in corporate taxes would have the same effect over the entire country, it's just much more transparent.	1351982574

You actually may have to be born in the United States.  There's no clear case law on it, but:\n\nYou must be natural born, not naturalized.  According to the US DoS Foreign Affairs Manual (7 FAM 1113, ACQUISITION OF U.S.\nCITIZENSHIP BY BIRTH), definitions\n\n&gt;Naturalization is “the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth, by any means whatsoever” (Section 101(a)(23) INA) or conferring of citizenship upon a\nperson (Sections 310 and 311 INA). Naturalization can be granted automatically or\npursuant to an application.\n\nNow, those born on American soil (7 FAM 1114, ):\n\n&gt;a. Until 1866, the citizenship status of persons born in the United States was not\ndefined in the Constitution or in any federal statute. Under the common law rule of jus soli--\nthe law of the soil-persons born in the United States generally acquired U.S. citizenship at\nbirth [see section 7 FAM 1116.1-1 ]. ...\n\n&gt; b. This rule was made part of the Civil Rights Act of April 9, 1866 (14 Stat. 27) and, 2 years later, it was adopted as part of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nAcquire citizenship _at birth_, and are therefore natural born.\n\nOn the other hand (7 FAM 1111.2, Citizenship):\n\n&gt;(2) Jus sanguinis (the law of the bloodline ), a concept of Roman or civil law under\nwhich a person’s citizenship is determined by the citizenship of one or both parents. This\nrule, frequently called “citizenship by descent” or “derivative citizenship”, is not embodied in\nthe U.S. Constitution, but such citizenship is granted through statute. As laws have\nchanged, the requirements for conferring and retaining derivative citizenship have also\nchanged.\n\nPeople who are born to American parents are _not_ citizens at birth (unless also born on American soil), and are therefore granted citizenship status statutorily.  If we apply this to our definition of naturalization above, then it's _possible_ that people who are citizens solely by virtue of blood may be considered naturalized.\n\nThis is further backed up by ACQUISITION OF U.S. CITIZENSHIP BY\nBIRTH ABROAD TO U.S. CITIZEN PARENT (7 FAM 1131.6-2 Eligibility for Presidency):\n\n&gt;a. It has never been determined definitively by a court whether a person\nwho acquired U.S. citizenship by birth abroad to U.S. citizens is a naturalborn\ncitizen within the meaning of Article II of the Constitution and,\ntherefore, eligible for the Presidency.	1306522883

&gt; This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the fact that chiropractors utilise a range of treatments, including postural advice, reassurance and exercise.\n\nSo, in addition to giving people massages, you tell them to sit upright and get some exercise?

If they are "medical treatments" they need to be tested also.	1245195438

If its thinning your worried about, another thing to focus on is the tightness of your scalp... You should be able to move it around quiet easily... If the skin gets too tights it constricts blood flow and the follicles start to die out. So while you have hair scalp massages are a good idea... Your stylist may have mentioned minerals because of the condition of your hair... Hard water and soft water can dry hair out if your not balancing the PH levels with good shampoo and conditioner. It's a tricky thing that thinning hair...  I wish you luck!! 	1354164616

Well, give us some credit; the lemurs don't do the logging themselves.  \n\nI think you have to consider that an alien race would have multiple interests.  So, saying they have an interest in us or an interest in some material, they don't have to be mutually exclusive.  You have to be practical and consider, though, that even an advanced alien race is probably still governed by basic economic needs.  Gold, or whatever other material, might be in scarce supply throughout the universe.  It would thus influence where you decided to set up a colony or puppet species/government.  \n\nExample: the United States has multiple interests, one of which is humanitarian aid and development.  But above all, there is economics.  And so while various countries around the world are suffering from civil war, starvation, genocide and the like, chances are the US usually only intervenes in those that pose a threat to our economic stability (read: have lots of oil).\n\nInterestingly enough, the gold harvesting theories could explain why contact has been minimal.  Aside from the natural concerns of not wanting to destroy human culture and delusions of free will, the aliens would also not want to reveal their *needs*.  If we knew they wanted/needed material goods from us, we'd have a strategic leverage point against them.\n\nWhy pay for the cow when you can mutilate it for free?	1305932325

You can't throw people away for the rest of their lives for murder unless they actually had malice and wanted to kill the child. Justice has to be measured and appropriate. If you have a justice system where your own personal pet peves are punished worse than other forms of manslaughter, then you'd have an unfair system indeed. \n\nBasically, wanting them to suffer worse punishment for manslaughter because you personally hate *their* reason more than other reasons is the same as people who also want *their* own personal vendettas carried out through the justice system. It's the same path that racists and religious fundamentalists take. What would be the difference between *your* religiously-based punishment and *their* religiously-based punishment? No, how about we instead punish people for the crimes that they actually commit? This couple committed manslaughter, and they are being punished for that crime.\n\nThese are the facts: their negligence criminally caused the death of their child. They didn't have malicious intent, and their culpability didn't meet the criteria of a worse or lighter charge than manslaughter.\n\nI'm really glad that the general sentiment in the comments here seems to completely disagree with you. It's a good thing that your "they should suffer worse because their religion is dumb" idea isn't popular. If you want to promote skepticism in the world, please do it through the marketplace of ideas, and not by demanding blood. Thanks.	1320342161

Determinism has already been shown to be defective in areas of quantum mechanics, so it's not an absolute.  (Not getting into woo here, just pointing out that determinism is not absolute.  We all know quantum effects don't directly apply to the macro level.)\n\nWhen you consider chaotic systems, which, unlike quantum effects, *do* directly apply to the macro world that we're all aware of, it is readily apparent that completely accurate predictions of behavior depend upon the ability to measure values with infinite precision, which is not possible.  Because of this, I would argue that determinism is not absolute at the macro level either.  Lacking the ability to measure with infinite precision,  we will never be able to completely predict behavior.  This makes the reality of the situation approximate free will.  I would argue that it's indistinguishable from free will, and in fact equal to free will in the same way that 0.9999... == 1.\n\nBecause we *appear* to have free will, I argue that the assertion that we do have free will should be the null hypothesis.  I believe that the burden of proof is on the determinists in this case, which so far remains unmet.  Every argument I've really heard from them is based on the assumption that determinism is absolute, and we already know it isn't.	1264254994

**B**  Warning:  Midnight Meat Train movie spoilers inside.\n\n!!\n\nOh shit.  I just read the [Wikipedia on Midnight Meat Train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Meat_Train).\n\nDamn.  That is a pretty damn cool twist, man.  I gotta say I kind've didn't really expect to see that coming.\n\nPretty darn cool.\n\nOkay, now that being said, I will still say that THIS particular scenario, I wouldn't necessarily say is one to "fear".\n\nThis is the deal:  Reptillians are said to be the *original* terrans.  They are said to call us humans THE ALIENS because they say they were here first and we are "newcomer babies" to this planet.\n\nThere is actually a bit of data on Repitillian information, not the least of which deal with the things that the African Shaman Credo Mutwa explains in detail.  Yeah.  For the most part, reptillians do pretty much seem to suck.\n\nBut, you know what? WE suck.  We human beings are sucky, shitty, ignorant assholes.  I mean why is it exactly that we say and feel Reptillians suck and are mean and scary?  It's because they treat us like we treat COWS.  So what's the big fucking deal then?  What's going on here is that we're getting the kind of treatment that we give untold MILLIONS of animals every year.\n\nHonestly I'd say serves us right.\n\nWe need to get our act straight.  If we figure our shit out, emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, etc, then we won't have much to fear.  We would really be growing far past all this Reptillian stuff, etc.  I don't feel there's much to fear even if Reptillians ARE real and they ARE using human beings as a food source like we use cows.\n\nWe are not our bodies.  We are not human beings.  We are spiritual identities that happen to be taking human physical shapes to manifest on this planet.\n\nWe need to focus and work from *that* place, and if we do, we will concentrate more on tending to and developing THAT true self - the spiritual self that is not dependent upon the physical body or organism.\n\nWhen one begins to understand this kind of reality and works toward focusing there, then the whole Reptillian thing - although I admit it can be pretty disconcerting (even if fake, to say nothing about how downright harrowing it would be if it is REAL) - is *still* nothing to ultimately fear in and of itself.\n\nIt is an obstacle to work and develope *through* - not something to fear and keep you from growing and moving forward.	1339442813

Alright here's the problem.\n\nThat device is going to generate hydrogen using electrolysis POWERED BY YOUR CAR'S BATTERY.  The battery gets it's energy from the running of the motor and the burning of gasoline.  Generating the hydrogen is going to actually REDUCE your gas mileage. \n\nSome of that energy (the conversion to hydrogen is inefficient) will be put back into the engine when the hydrogen is burned.  Obviously though because this is a closed loop you can only hurt the vehicle's gas mileage by doing this.	1291091636

One of my favorite bands, Epica, is coming out with a new concept album called "Design Your Universe".\n\n&gt;The album title, 'Design Your Universe', deals with new breakthroughs in quantum physics. It proves that we are all connected to each other on subatomic level. Also, it shows that we can create or at least influence matter with our thoughts… a very interesting fact. Because it changes everything for us, our whole worldview collapses once you accept these facts and integrate them in your lives. So this had to become the new album title.\t\n[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Your_Universe)\n\nTheir music is fabulous and I'll probably end up seeing them in concert, but I won't be agreeing with this album &gt;_&lt;	1249716735

&gt; I grew up in a house in [Aurora](http://www.ufocasebook.com/Aurora.html), Texas, and not only did I live close to where the purported alien crashed, but my father built our house with our back fence to where the windmill was knocked down by the craft. (EDIT: also, our house was a few hundred yards from the cemetery where it was buried)\nRaised in a religious home, but I always had my thoughts about what "God" was capable of creating if he made us. Then as I slowly drifted away from those ideas and towards a logic and reason based life, those ideas began to evolve.\n\n\n\n**Actual Story**\n\nOne year, my parents went on vacation and I was left at home with my cousin watching me for a few nights. I was about fourteen years old at the time (2005). Little did they know, he had barely been there at all because of his dutiful party schedule. Three nights in a row, I recall having the most peculiar dreams I've ever experienced. Firstly, I never remember falling asleep. Not before that and never since then have I been able to recall the last moments before drifting off, but these nights were different. I remember seeing the normal bright vivid colors on the back of my eyelids but then suddenly after about 10 minutes they slowed and stopped. It was as if my eyes were open in a completely pitch black environment with no sound whatsoever. I'm not sure if it was just quiet in my room, but eventually I couldn't even hear my heartbeat. Two white lights began to creep in from a distance, but it felt more warm than bright. I could *feel* the light, more than see it. Then for some reason my brain knew it was sleeping or something, so it may have gone into dream mode.\n\nFor about thirty seconds, I felt like my body was weightless, then another bright light that I could actually see in my dream more than feel came into view. Everything went black for a split second and then I felt myself extremely cold, but still lying down. Things became fuzzier after my body feeling came back, but I still felt like I was dreaming, just not in control of what I was doing. Then, something fucking crazy happened. I see the two lights again coming in from the side and as they get closer, they dim out and there are two faces with translucent black eyes staring at me. I immediately knew it was a dream but was so excited that I was dreaming about aliens that I wanted to go along with it. Normally when I do that in dreams, I'm awoken, but this one was weird.\n\nThey continued their warm presence which was all I could really describe what I felt at the time, and all I wanted to do was ask them questions. I could hear myself asking them in my head but I couldn't talk, and (just like the 'god' voice people hear in their heads) I heard soothing sounds and what sounded like words made of electricity or energy. It wasn't like a voice or a resonance of vocal chords, but more like frequencies emitted that I could kind of sense.. Really hard to explain.\n\n\nThis continued for maybe twenty minutes at most and then my dream went back to black. Woke up feeling great but wished I had dreamt more, as long as I had slept and all. \n\n\nThis would be shrugged off normally, but if you remember from above, nearly the *exact* same dream occurred for two nights after that. The *feelings* more than visuals, the inexplicable voices in my head, the drifting off to sleep consciously.. I don't know what happened to me, and I've never really written it out before, so I'm going to assume it was a dream until they come back this year. Haaah.	1327766393

First thing I would do is try to shake it's hand. IMO they have been studying us for longer than we think and would know a hand shake means no threat. Afterwords I would give him/her/it a grand tour of my house, as any respectful human would do. I would answer any question they had, if any. Only then would I begin to ask them the works of the universe and if there's a reason why they are here. So in other words, I would treat them as if they were my own, and would expect the same from them. Even if it means being kicked in the balls as a form of "Hello".	1352240418

please refer to the NIH's and Hopkin's most recent studies involving acupuncture and pain relief, fertility, mental and emotional health...etc.  also, be aware that the education some of us receive includes more allopathic medical training in the first two years than the majority of RNs.  we spend more time in clinical settings in the US and abroad than a Hopkins student.  we are mastering not only the utilization of herbal remedies (where all pharmaceuticals are originally based), manual manipulation of joints and muscle, trigger point massage (used in allopathic medicine based on chinese medicine), psychological counseling, and dietary training.  Now, I fully agree that there are frauds and fakes out there but i do what i do because after being offered a full ride to Hopkins, I decided to pursue a more wholistic approach.  afterall, something that has withstood the test of 4000 years must have some validity.  and while i know it is anecdotal, without chinese medicine I would not be alive...fortunately, i have helped several hundred people around the country with the skills i have gleaned.  please do some research before you bag it completely. although i understand the skeptic mind, I'd like to remind you that any good skeptic and scientist is beholden to at least test the hypothesis they pose.   	1318754515

I think that speech must be almost absolutely free, but people should be encouraged (but not coerced) through example, education, etc. to use their speech responsibly.  In fact, I would say that the law as it stands is pretty effective, the only thing I would change is to make people slightly more liable for their words.  In this case, for instance, I think that the parents of sick children, whose children who either did get vaccinated or were medically unable to get vaccinated should be able to sue figureheads of the anti-vax movement.  (That is not to say they can not currently, I just think that that is the most important way to combat such nonsense)	1317696525

I love this casein/glue argument.  They like to ignore the fact that many "excellent glues" are made from things like rice and flour.  You know what I use to make my books?  A mixture of flour and water.  Flour + water + heat + stirring = quite a sturdy book glue.  So maybe you shouldn't be eating fried dough or bread anything while drinking water... b/c you know, glue.  ... and all glue is always toxic...  Oh and if only they knew just how many things casein was used in.  It's used as a binding agent in anything from medicine to nail polish to soy cheese (which a lot of people mistakenly consider to be vegan).	1346015360

I'm kind of surprised that there is so much support on /r/skeptic for this movement. I'd never heard about it before today, but watching their lectures, reading their literature, and seeing interviews with the Venus Project's founder, all lead me to the same conclusion. **This is a movement, not of scientists, but science fans.** They have no grasp on the reality of what they are saying. \n\n[This is the Venus project](http://thevenusproject.com/index.php) that is being promoted by the Zeitgeist Movement. You'll notice that they will give you an e-book in exchange for your email address. [This is that e-book.](http://thevenusproject.com/index.php) Read it; it is full of vagaries and wishful science fandom. Now, watch [a 1974 interview with the founder of the project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVOPkGAtt48), and author of the aforementioned e-book. If your woo-dar isn't going off yet, take a look at [a project](http://www.rbefoundation.com/) to work out the details of resource-based economy. Finally, notice [this section](http://www.rbefoundation.com/documentaries.php?c=2) of the REBEF site. This doesn't seem to be a movement of critical thinkers.	1314225445

A lot of his other stuff is spot on. He generally speaks with an erudite wit. Also, being serious about the reptile thing is what has kept the anti-defamation league from suing him.

You are right that "all" is a bit strong. However, the reason people think that they have any effect at all is because researchers can never bring themselves to more certainty than "it is highly unlikely that homeopathic remedies have any effect", even if they contradict laws of physics and chemistry. People interprent "very probably have no effect" as "could possibly have some effect". People need to be taught that when a scientist says "it is highly improbable this homeopathic remedy will cure you"  he means it in the same way as when he says "it is highly improbable that a narwhal will materialize in front of you and start singing christmas carols". Any sane person would know the narwhal thing would never happen .. but one could not know that _for sure_. \n\nAs for people using "homeopathy" to describe anything other than substances so diluted that they are unlikely to contain a single molecule of the original substance.. I haven't really heard about that before. 	1300719151

In fact he said "don't take this the wrong way", said he found her interesting, asked her for coffee. My point is that if someone finds that implicitly threatening... it's a personal problem, not a societal one... or maybe it is societal problem, just the other way around. \n	1310338286
For your list, the first n in my name is lower case...\n\nSince insurance is tax-deductible while ... money isnt, that artificially increases the price of insurance by pushing the supply/demand curve, since people are able to spend more on insurance.\n\nAs someone who pays for insurance out of pocket, its a lot.\n\nIf, otoh, this tax was reinstated, the price would go down due to the simple laws of economics (many could not afford insurance at that price, therefore the price would go down the demand curve).\n\nBut I appreciate you knowing so much that you don't have to make logical arguments, you can use faux-common-sense to magically ignore reality.\n\nAlso, I would assume you are a capitalist, this is a capitalist solution, let the market sort this shit out, don't try to pick winners. Personally, as someone who is relatively healthy (and has a medical background) I have no problem paying for healthcare out of pocket, and consider the presidents mandate to be quite vexing, but at least taxing it will bring the private cost of insurance back into balance with the cost via organized health plans.	1283578815

The problem with the Monty Hall problem is that we are much better at avoiding trickery than we are at doing math.\n\nOn a real gameshow, you assume that opening another door and asking if you want to switch is *optional*, and the host is trying to trick contestants sometimes.  Under this analysis, you might deduce that the host wouldn't offer you a chance to switch unless you *had* picked the car.\n\nBut this isn't the setup of the Monty Hall problem: to get the standard "you should switch" argument to work, you need the assumption that the host's probability of showing you a goat and asking if you want to switch is independent of whether you have initially chosen the car or not.\n\nFor example, suppose that the host only offers contestants a chance to switch if they already have chosen the car.  If that's how the host acts, you should never switch.  As another example, suppose that most contestants switch when offered the chance to do so, that the show's producers have a fixed number of cars they want to give away, and that the producers have told the host to try to give away the right number of cars.  If that's the case, then you should guess whether the show has been giving away lots of cars, and choose whether to switch accordingly.\n\ntl;dr: The standard analysis relies on the host's behavior being independent of your initial choice.  People don't generally do that outside of math problems.	1297186496
Interestingly enough, we could survive on only meat. \n\n[This](http://www.jbc.org/content/87/3/651.full.pdf) is a study done by two men who ate nothing but animal parts for an entire year and were perfectly healthy. \n\nI honestly think the only major health issue as far as food goes in the Western world is over consumption. Vegans are proof that we can do without meat, that shows we can do without everything else, and the dietician that lost all that weight by eating nothing but twinkies and vitamins showed even on shit we can still lose weight. \n\nIf only we had an ounce of self control.	1334890099

The creep-factor is as much from the near-humanity of it as from any predatory features. The unnaturally thin, deformed limbs and head suggest illness or death, which triggers a whole other set of ingrained aversion responses. \n\nAlso there's some "uncanny valley" effect there, where something not-quite-right is more disturbing than something clearly different from us. That sort of 'alien' feeling is heightened by having it move like a quadruped despite having human-like anatomy (this also feeds into the predator thing, as most predators are quadrupeds).\n	1338997505

The problem I have isn't in the thought that people try to do something like the idea behind NWO. I have a problem with the absurd notion that anyone would be capable of it, even if they had the necessary influence and power (which would require a level of cooperation that I am skeptical of). The simple truth is that we incredibly shitty at predicting our own culture(s).

hey, I have to take a vision test to drive a car, and I theoretically have to prove that I know how to drive it safely without running other people down (although that's a subject that's up for debate, since driving tests in this country are pathetic as far as actually determining whether or not someone is a safe driver, but  that's for another debate). I own two shotguns (not entirely by choice - they've been in the family for generations) and never had to take a test to legally own them when they passed from dad to me, never had to prove that I could see (which seems, you know, important. Would suck if I shot the wrong blur because I was nearly blind). My SO has guns that she bought herself, and never had to take a vision test for them, and since they're hunting rifles, never had to take the classes/tests/etc that you'd have to take to carry a concealed handgun. \n\n\nBTW, many municipalities forbid you from having unregistered cars on your property - mainly to keep people from having junker cars up on blocks in the driveway and bringing property values down. So the argument can be quite successfully made that cars are far more regulated than firearms. Hell, many places have required vehicle inspections to make sure that your car is safe. My shotguns have never been inspected by any experts to see if they're safe to use (and in truth, they probably aren't. They haven't been fired or cleaned since I was a little kid, and have been sitting in basements and attics un-cased since then).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concealed-carry requirements don't apply, because I can't conceal my car while driving around. Better to look at open carry laws. 	1356036339

I like that the climate and environment of a country that never raised cattle prior to us bringing them there is getting the credit for this and not the anal-retentive devotion to perfection that the japanese are known for. Kobe beef is delicious because the meat is extremely well-marbled and the cows get very little excercise. It's also expensive because the japanese are spending ten times as much money feeding the cow. The implication that the same techniques can't be replicated out of japan is disingenuous to the extreme and it just shows that the aritcle writer is a food snob, not a skeptic or a scientist.	1334506966

Religion was invented, for lack of a better word, to explain strange phenomena in some sort of orderly fashion to the so called "primitive minds".

&gt;Not necessarily; different studies in evolutionary studies have shown there to be a common theme between attractiveness and things like facial symmetry, specific proportions and hair texture.\n\nThings are still only as beautiful as we perceive them to be. That we are biologically pre-disposed to like certain features does not change that; it just explains overall patterns in things humans see as beautiful.\n\n&gt;If you wanted to do something from a completely objective point of view it would be seeing how common the occurrences of such traits are in a specific race.\n\nBut that's almost irrelevant. How people rate attractiveness is much more important information. If people rate blacks as less attractive even though they are perfectly symmetric and have perfect facial ratios, then that is valuable information and not something you pick up on just by measuring people.\n\n&gt;if we are to assume that the study can be based on opinionated statistics yet still be labelled as objective)\n\nThe statistics are not opinionated, the statistics are measuring opinion. And that's fine, because beauty is just a type of opinion.	1306367032

&gt; This statement is false. I need only provide one example that falsifies (b). Lets say a company produces electricity from a nuclear reactor and dumps the waste into a water supply. Some of the people (lets say 1,000) that drink the water get cancer and have to pay $1,000 each for a cure. Total cost to society of power plant: 1 million.\n&gt; Lets say a coal plant could have produced the same amount of electricity but without the deaths, but would have cost the company .1 million more. You can even assume if you like that it would cause .5 million in damage to society from asthma if you like.\n\nLet's assume that travel by airplane is less safe than travel by car.  (Check figures of deaths by nuclear plants vs deaths by coal power plants, you'll see how this fits right in)\n\nLet us now proceed to draw an irrelevant conclusion that does not reflect reality because the assumptions are flat out disconnected from reality.\n\nLet us now pretend that I have made a cogent, relevant post.\n\nLet us now pretend that I am being downvoted because my contribution to this post was logical and meaningful.\n\nLet us now complain about me being downvoted three times in a single thread. \n\n:-)	1315375472

There's no need to consider all possible possibilities separately. Take them all together, and remember them as a nudge to consider the extraordinary.

I personally think skepticism cant be something that is bestowed onto others, rather something you need to find out for yourself. \nHearing about quackery and charlatans might raise awareness of it, but until you lose money, see friends/family losing money or at the very worst see your own or somebody else's health deteriorate as a result of things like homoeopathy or spiritual healers, you can't really appreciate the real need for skepticism in life. \n\nAtheism is something that can be bestowed onto others though. To teach a child the origins of the universe, without the need for fruity metaphores and stupid mythos, you can get across a logical, well cited, factual explanation for it that cannot be refuted. \n\nUnfortunately people can find more and more slippery ways to trick you into getting your money and until you see it happen to you and yours, you won't fully appreciate the real need for skepticism.\n\nWhereas atheists have a lot of skepticism towards any rhetoric a religious person throws at them or anything anybody says that sounds like it was cited from scripture, atheism doesn't really have any connections to general skepticism, as a lot of atheists tend to have general secular beliefs that could adhere to a lot of this pseudo science bullshit. 	1341782814
It's a cheap additive which is a result of a large industrial process. Its a component which any reasonable consumer wouldn't expect in their ground beef - this being pieces of beef and fat of a particular percentage ground up and packaged. And because this beef required disinfecting, it's obviously not a wholesome ingredient in the first place. \n\nSince the use of this was not listed in the ingredients, it's a component which the processor is obviously not proud of using.\n\nAll of these factors lead any reasonable consumer to feel cheated and abused. It reminds all consumers that getting the most money from them is the one and only goal of any large food processor and/or retail operation.\n\nIt's one thing to add this to a product like hot dogs which are produced with trimmings and scraps and then ground an homogenized. It's another to add this as a hidden component.\n\nI look forward to heavy and costly class-action suites against Cargil and other mega-food processors and markets.	1332896492

Many of this article's arguments lie soundly on the former side of said gulf, while its conclusions lie on the latter.\n\nFor what it's worth, the dairy industry does tend to sell its product with questionable health claims.  But I wouldn't make a strong claim about its health effects without some kind of study, say a comparison between lactose tolerant/intolerant folks.	1353344361

I saw a UFO once. Then it was identified.\n\nIt's a massive jump from UFO to alien space craft, and one of those idiots said it's unreasonable to expect stronger evidence than testimony. Perhaps. But it's still completely irrational to jump to the conclusion that they were extraterrestrial space craft without compelling evidence. All you can state is that it was, at least for you, a UFO.	1302307646
Tho I agree that psychiatrist have been overdiagnosing and over medicating people without necesity, calling autism a made-up condition is completely false and disrespectful to those who have to deal with this.\n\nThe fact that there are assholes who will take advantage of our lack of understanding of the causes and inner workings of this condition doesen't change that some families do have to go through this dificulty.	1327058726

&gt;Skeptics don't deny climate change.\n\nNo, because they accept the evidence behind anthropogenic climate change.\n\n&gt;Most of us agree with the global warming alarmists\n\nUse of the word "alarmist" betrays you agenda. People who accept the current science are not alarmists.\n\n&gt;We are also skeptical of the alarmists' catastrophic predictions.\n\nDefine "catastrophic predictions." The current science indicates a climate sensitivity of 2 to 4.5C, which a likeliest value of 3C, for a doubling of CO2.\n\n&gt;This article explains the global warming debate\n\nNo, that article is a piece of anti-science propaganda similar to those you post daily on /r/climateskeptics. It is quite revealing that you always post links to blogs and Conservative-leaning organizations, but not from actual scientists.\n\nWhat I find really pathetic is how you always use the same copy/pasted responses to make it sound as if you are a rational and reasonable contributor to reddit, when it takes only a few minutes of reading your actual submissions to understand you're nothing but a propaganda relayer.\n\nOh, and you still managed to change the subject. Every time you do, you confirm my original point (and further show the folks at [/r/skeptic](/r/skeptic) how you guys really aren't skeptics at all - after all, they only have to read you past comments to see what you really think of them). Undoubtedly you'll avoid responding in your next post as well, followed by another of your pre-canned responses, I imagine.\n\nPerhaps you don't realize how much you sound like an actual PR hack.

I saw the same type of object over my high school in central Florida, last year. It popped up in the sky multiple times, shifted colors, and made seemingly impossible maneuvers.

I can't argue with you because I do not have any information to claim in contrary, however, the only "evidence" we have of ET visits have been overwhelmingly positive. Naturally, the sensational "I twer probed in my butt parts!" and alien invasion genre movies are very extremely accessible to the general public, some of the fringe religions and spiritualists (including the Hopi Indians, modern followers of the Aztec religions and some eastern cultures to name a few) view visitation as direct contact with their deities. It does come down to personal belief because there are no hard facts to refer to, but my understanding which has been built through a lifetime of curiosity about life (within and outside our planet) and spiritual growth has led me to believe that our 'first contact' will likely be positive. A positive outlook on visitors to our planet will undoubtedly lead to a positive interaction if and when that interaction occurs.	1352154386

That's actually what makes it so damnably popcorn-worthy (and me trying to eat healthy!)—that homeopathy's arbitrary, make-believe rules are considered too stringent and unwieldy for the average naturopath to find profitable, so they should be simplified in order to bring them into line with the arbitrary, make-believe rules which govern the rest of naturopathic canon.\n\nIt's like kids at a birthday party ganging up on the one kid who wants to play Monopoly when the rest of them would rather stick with Candy Land.	1339786158

&gt;But to think that humans are the pinnacle of civilization not just on Earth but in the entire galaxy is pretty arrogant in my opinion.\n\nOh, definitely. I couldn't agree with you more. But that has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not those Temple vids are real or not.\n\nOf course I don't know either, if they are or aren't. I'd like them to be, and maybe you are right. Personally I strongly suspect that they are a hoax based upon a multitude of similar incidents over the years that were initially praised/hyped and then eventually disproven, but I also honestly think that, regardless, it matters less than you think because videos will *never* be considered proof of UFOs. Ever. There are already many vids out there that are very compelling and probably very real. Ones that many people also think are fakes.\n\nEither way I don't need to be sure about these tapes, but that may be because I am convinced about the reality of UFOs for other reasons. Just don't lose your own beliefs if these are eventually shown to be fake. It has no bearing upon the reality of the phenomenon.	1297488709

Just because it is possible to postulate something, does not mean it is reasonable to do so.  \n\nThe simplest solution is that they are hearing noises from something mundane like an aircraft, or construction work.  The fact that there exists multiple videos of similar sounds from the billions of hours of video available does not make a strong case.\n\nThere is very little reason to suspect that these noises are related.  They could be related, but that still gives you no reason to suspect that they are not mundane phenomenon. This is [auditory pareidolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia), combined with [The Pattern Seeking Fallacy](http://blog.asmartbear.com/pattern-seeking-fallacy.html)\n\nI was dismissive because of how preposterous it is to ascribe importance to meaningless stimulus.

Funny thing about Zicam.

They get around this by making weaselly claims to do things like "boost the immune system." They also carry a disclaimer on the packaging that says something to the effect of, "This product is not meant to treat or cure any disease" in super tiny small print. So, legally, you can't do anything about homeopathy or herbal remedies unless they specifically claim to treat or prevent disease.	1308721338

We had a full blood Chow named Sheena, she was given to my mother by my father on mothers day the year I was born. Well about 10 years ago Sheena got really sick the vets couldn't do anything for her because she was pretty old, The day before we were scheduled to take her in to put her to 'sleep' she didn't wake up.. Sadly Sheena had passed in her sleep. Well, as creepy as this sounds Sheena used to sit next to my moms couch and would scratch her self you'd hear the jiggle of this little charm/name tag she had. We still have the couch and if you sit on the right cushion at night you can sometimes hear a "jiggle" of a chain or what sounds like change. This has actually brought my mother to tears before and I've heard her say "Go to sleep Sheena" and it would stop.	1340610401

Most are doubtful, some are dangerous.  Drinking other people's breastmilk is sharing a fluid, so there's a risk of disease including HIV.  These risks are outweighed by the immunological benefit conferred on the infant, but probably not worth it for an adult.\n\nChemo and transplant patients are likely to have things going on with their immune systems which makes breast milk (or other non-pasteurized substances) a bad idea.  Applying breast milk to a serious burn seems like a bad idea as well.\n\nI don't have any research on this; maybe I am wrong. However I would suggest the onus of evidence is on the claimant.	1299564469

&gt; It wasn't clear to me whether you were being skeptical of helmet use per se or of helmet laws. Sort of a mishmash of both, then?\n\nI became skeptical of the usefulness of mandatory helmet laws.\n\nThe data for helmets being useful in certain types of accident is convincing but there data showing that helmets reduce the percentage of riders who suffer head injuries is not.\n\nMy theory for Australia, and I can't find any good data for this either way, is that people were already wearing helmets in situations that made sense. So the mandatory helmet law here really only discouraged people that weren't at a high risk.\n\nIt's a political no-go area here. Most people will never question it and politician's simply aren't interested. It's lead to some fairly heated discussions about the Melbourne bicycle share scheme's lack of success.\n\n&gt; Have you seen the IIHS data?\n\nI had not, thank you. That's exactly the kind of data I was looking for.\n\nI'd really like to also see data comparing rates before and after mandatory helmet laws are introduced. What little we have for Australia and New Zealand shows no meaningful change. There aren't any other countries with helmet laws as strict as either of ours. We're often actually used as an example of the folly of such laws internationally, it seems.	1311809556

Not necessarily. When I still worked in TV news, we called that "Teleprompter Eye." Interns and new anchors would look quite a bit like that when staring into the camera. They were so amped up about being on camera and getting it right that they wouldn't blink. It was especially bad when they were reading their script on the prompter, but even when there wasn't a prompter, they'd still do it.\n	1340224461
You've probably heard of him. He wrote the Watchmen, V for Vendetta, and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book series, among many others. He's a pretty brilliant guy.	1309225211
Wow... Super, super bad science. The second paragraph:\n\n"Finding only one case of the disease in the investigation of hundreds of Egyptian mummies, with few references to cancer in literary evidence, proves that cancer was extremely rare in antiquity. The disease rate has risen massively since the Industrial Revolution, in particular childhood cancer – proving that the rise is not simply due to people living longer."\n\nQuestions that immediately come to mind:\n\n* Who was being mummified? Everyone? Or just certain people?\n* Out of that number, how many of those mummies exist today?\n* Is an analysis of cancer in ancient literature in any way valid?\n\nI don't know about the first two, but the third I'd have to answer with a resounding "NO!" While you might find some references to cancers that are visible growths on the skin, damn near every other kind of cancer is going to be a "wasting disease" or something of that sort in the literature of old, and entirely useless for an analysis like this.	1287118713

Here's the worst part:\n\nA libel suit like this is a covert shifting of the burden of proof. \n\n    WDDTY says "Sunbeams cure diabetes."\n    Singh says: "There's no evidence of that. You're fooling people."\n\nWhat WDDTY *should reply*: \n\n    a) oh you're right, we don't have evidence, we'll retract that, or \n    b) no, we do have evidence, and here it is!\n\nInstead, with a lawsuit, what they're saying is: \n\n    Saying that we're fooling people is libel *until you prove that we are in fact fooling people*. \n\nNow Singh has to make a case for the sun *not* curing diabetes. He's been given the burden of proof. If he fails, his claim is defamation. What the actual * * * * Libel should be about unfounded attacks on a person (or, I guess, an organization). The proper questioning of ideas and vocal concern about the consequences of those ideas *is not libel*.	1349338136

Thanks TheTartanDervish! You are the first person so far who responded to me that have actually experienced this technique, though you don't know it as EFT. I have heard of EFT practitioners bringing EFT to [Rwanda](http://www.eftuniverse.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4333) as well as to [veterans](http://www.nwmedicalhypnosis.com/documents/The%20treatment%20of%20combat%20veterans%20using%20EFT.pdf) so I believe that what you experienced is indeed EFT even if the instructor didn't call it by that name. \n\nDifferent practitioners may teach EFT in different ways, so I don't know how did you learn it, but when you were told to do the tapping, were you asked to focus on the triggering memory or the feelings of panic at the same time? If you were, then even if you were partially distracted by the tapping, a part of you will still be connected to the memory or feeling. At least this is how I teach EFT to my clients, by asking them to focus on the issue while tapping. I would be interested to know how you used the technique. \n\nI don't know how you define the word "treatment", but to me, the fact that it provides relief makes it a treatment, and there is scientific evidence for EFT as a form of therapy which I mentioned in my original post. May I know why would you be skeptical of EFT as a treatment? \n\nMay I know what was your experience of EFT? It's ok if it's too personal to share, but I am sure there are others who would be interested to know. 	1342971260

The thing about this, is that skeptics never give a shit when they're wrong.  They'll go with a theory with decades, then it turns out it was another misidentification altogether, and they're still gonna be like "I told you so!".  \n\nIn my opinion this is more likely a piece of glitter that got caught in the wind.  The tumbling action and the two sides of bright reflection is more likely in this case.  	1353518255
As I understand it the consensus on Valerian root in ordinary pill form for sleep is a wee bit more positive, than Vitamin C for a cold. I have taken it for my own insomnia, and I at least feel as though it had a calming effect on me, but my mind was still so busy and anxious that it didn't have any really positive effect for my sleep. So I just switched back to marijuana :P Pricier, but no skepticism required lol. That shit works.\n\nAlso you might consider taking the valerian root in conjunction with melotonin pills. When I took them together for a few days it did seem to help me more than just the valerian. 	1321828282

The risk of complications may be low statistically, but were a complication such as obstetric hemorrhage to occur, it could be almost immediately fatal.  \n\n5 minutes to the hospital is too long in that scenario.\n\nSome might argue that 5 minutes is too far to the hospital in lots of non-childbirth related cases that are statistically more likely to occur.  My personal opinion, though, is this:  Why risk it when the outcome could be your child being born motherless?\n\nI would rather have all the medical facilities immediately accessible to address any complications the mother or child might experience.  Still not a 100% guarantee of survival, but should complications arise, it drastically increases the odds for both mom and kiddo.	1298064128
There is a gulf of insanity between the average mildly-religious person who wants to believe they won't die and someone has a plan for the universe, and the full-blown psychotic who actually thinks demons are running around causing headaches and sucking gay dicks.\n\nInsofar as skepticism is largely about public education, it might be worth recognizing the distinction. It's hard to know where to begin with the latter group; it might be a complete lost cause.	1353979636

&gt;Would you be concerned if a scientist said that "Evolution is true"?\n\nYes, because it is an equally ridiculous statement.

No it's not. Extreme experiences induced by hallucinogenic drugs can suggest legitimate (if rash) hypotheses. Real stupidity would be to deduce that these experiences are conclusive proof rather than avenues of inquiry. Blackmore went ahead and probed such avenues, accepted the randomness of her results and after years of research admitted to being wrong. This, I call guts. Her only fault is buying too quickly into the hypotheses suggested by her experiences with drugs, something that, more often than we would like to admit, we are all guilty of.  	1284890364

Like Stross, I take a skeptical view of the time table put forth by Kurzwiel and all the utopian promises made by the singularitarians. The movement smacks too much of wishful thinking and something to fill a void for people who are atheist only out of fashion than a true non-belief.\n\nUnlike the author, I however do believe that something like the singularity could occur. My reasoning is this: I, you and everyone we know and who has ever lived are examples of what we (loosely and with much debate) define as 'intelligent'. Now disregarding any unprovable supernatural elements, you and I are mere patterns of atoms and electricity. There are people undoubtedly 'smarter' than us who are just slightly altered versions of the same pattern. They're over six billion samples of intelligence on this planet right now, that came about with no other influence other than nature's. If patterns like ours can sprout up with only evolution as a guide, than creating something like us artificially should be possible.\n\nIf we fully understand the pattern that defines 'us' and gain the technology to replicate the pattern and alter it: We'll have something we created that is more intelligent than the creators which is then capable to create another even more intelligent entity. This is the biggest step towards the post-singularity infinite rate of technological progression.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be a computer program as a genetically modified clone could just as easily get the ball rolling. As long as we create something smarter than us, it doesn't matter if the pattern resides on a server somewhere or inside a skull.\n\nI can't imagine placing a timetable on this and I think anyone who does is just yanking our chain to sell books and seats at expensive seminars. The singularity just means: anything past this point is unpredictable. It doesn't mean instant utopia, eternal life and some form of demi-godhood for you. It just means: "Undefined."\n\nOh and by the way, Accelerando sucked. There's a lot better singularity Sci-Fi out there with more likable characters.\n\n**tl;dr:** I think the singularity could happen, but there's a lot of noise in the signal. Beware people who claim to know when it'll occur or want to tell you all about how awesome it is for a nominal fee.\n	1309053417

Look more into what?\n\nLook, you're asking me to present a thorough case using only primary evidence for a set of scientific discoveries being discovered only by humans without the help of Aliens.  I can't present this case.  I also know that you can't present a persuasive case to the contrary. \n\n I can however point you to every other scientific breakthrough in the history of humanity, discoveries that required moments of brilliance and departures from generally held thoughts, that were sometimes so revolutionary that they may have appeared to come out of nowhere.  Was Godel inspired by Aliens when he discovered his Incompleteness Theorem?  Was Einstein just copying Aliens when he proposed General and Special Relativity? Did Darwin get his ideas for Natural Selection from Aliens?  If your argument is that Aliens helped us create the semi-conductor because it "came out of nowhere", then every other scientific discovery that seemingly "came out of nowhere" was also given to us by Aliens, or your argument is flawed.  I don't need to give you an extensive history of the transistor to show that your argument is, quite frankly, bullshit.  I just need to apply your general argument to the wealth of Humanity's scientific discoveries and show a contradiction.\n\nAs for holding "UFOs to sme crazy level of standards", I don't think I am.  I think it's reasonable to expect some form of consistent, testable evidence before reaching a definitive conclusion.  \n\n	1329000727
I'm a merchant mariner and this show drives me nuts because it props up people that are using very dangerous tactics.

I wouldn't say it was a huge benefit to the US to get involved in Afghanistan and Iraq. It furthered the administration's foreign policy goals, but in the long run turned out to be a costly mistake with no clear victory. As I said, if the goal had been to remove the Taliban and Saddam all along, an event like 9/11 was not necessary to carry that out. They simply seized on the opportunity when it presented itself.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to be skeptical but I believe we have established by now that the US government did not have a role in planning or carrying out the attacks. There is simply no proof.	1354827524

I agree it would be nice to have one irrefutable piece of evidence put forward, but in the meantime... there's an eye-opening exercise at hand that is to put 'all the pieces together', that serves as evidence just the same; all the evidence ever collected over the years...reports, accounts, testimonies, research initiatives, photos, videos...all of that accounts for evidence of a genuine phenomenon, whether pathological or otherworldly in nature. \n\nThat's worthy of more research and open discourse, imo. Contemplating random photos and videos will always send us in a worthless tailspin. 	1322944952

I am trying to raise the question, and you may take it as an attack if you like. \nIt seems like even raising a legitimate question, which him owning slaves in a government that he headed, in which the ruling class owned 93% of the wealth, and owned serfs or slaves, certainly is.  It is also reported in multiple sources that his party owned approximately 6,000 slaves.  When I raise the question, though, I am attacked as though I have an ulterior motive or something.  Or people accuse me of being a Chinese sympathizer, when I think that the Chinese government is one of the worst in history.\n\nNobody should be beyond question, and it seems as though he is.   Even posting a differing viewpoint elicits anger and scorn from nearly anyone on Reddit, much in the way criticism of Mother Teresa used to before all those stories came out.  Instead of researching it, everyone of the 50+ sources I have shown to others have been dismissed, and I have been accused of bias.  I don't know of many other public figures that get this level of loyalty and support without question.  It seems fishy, when he said that he lied for years about taking the CIA's money and guns to train guerilla fighters, after denying for 50 years that he did it.\n\nLet me ask you why you think I'm attacking him when all I'm doing is raising legitimate questions?  And why does it "seem painfully obvious?"  It is a 6 word, direct question I asked.

Yes, and that is not equivalent to "Islam is the only source of Middle Eastern problems." But it is pretty similar to "Islam is the major source of problems in the Middle East."\n\nIf I edited the image to clarify that it is the major source of problems in the Middle East, would you then agree with this post and what I've been saying all along??\n\nBecause I feel like the major source of animosity in this thread, is the fact that people think I am claiming if we just get rid of religion, somehow the Middle East will become Europe---never do I say that. I am simply saying that Islam is a major source of problem and we shouldn't be so reluctant to dismiss the influence of religion has on these countrys' tragic situations.	1347871351

I took the time to look up the "founders" of higher criticism or as he called it, the critical historical method, I saw that of the one of the first men to apply that kind of reasoning to the study of the bible, was a catholic priest. He was very controversial on many of his views (advocate of free will and stuff) but he was still a priest. I think a priest, even one who fancies himself as a philosopher born of the age of reason, will hardly apply any form of criticism in a way that would be so detrimental to his faith. Using “reason” in this way is quite convenient when it comes to validating one’s “holy” texts. Then again, the man could have been without bias… because the Church is well known for that.	1306446780
From the article: \n\n&gt; The helmets shielded their wearers from radio waves over most of the tested spectrum ... but, surprisingly, amplified certain frequencies: those in the 2.6 Ghz ( allocated for mobile communications and broadcast satellites) and 1.2 Ghz (allocated for aeronautical radionavigation and space-to-Earth and space-to-space satellites) bands. \n\nExcuse me? They're saying that a simple piece of foil can *amplify* a signal? Where exactly is the power for this amplification coming from? \n\nNow, I could believe that a conical shaped foil hat might focus radiation that leaks in from below since it will "trap" it inside the hat... \n\nAnyway, any paranoid person with a little bit of sense knows that the only truly effective tinfoil setup is one that covers the whole body, going all the way to the ground.

This may be weird to most of you if not all of you, but when I went to school in the... ahhhemm..  1960's, our straw wrappers, not the straws, were sweet tasting.  Yeah, they were so sweet, us kids would chew the paper of the straw.  Why would these wrappers be tasting so sweet?  I don't know, but I did hear some rumors of them being sweetened with aspartame.  What's with that?  Was this a testing ground?  Were we guinea pigs for the product?  I am only now questioning this since I see no need for aspartame to be used in straw wrappers, and the sweetness is still in my memory and I can assure you it was aspartame.	1278716785

Awesome. A bit about my confirmation bias: I've had pot 6 times in 8+ years and haven't cared for it. I much prefer alcohol. A couple of times I've had pot because I was traveling, forgot my painkillers, ended up in a bad situation, and the only painkillers strong enough people had on them were medical pot, which works, but is short lived and kind of annoying. One thing that I have found to be fascinating about pot is how drastically different some strands are. It is almost like pot is multiple different types of drugs under one name.\n\nAnyways, the study doesn't go over brain chemistry, or 'brain damage' yet it implies as much. I think people forget that IQ change in a person is tied to personality, not genetics, and therefor to look at IQ change you look towards personality change not brain development. The idea that minors have a lower IQ from something physical and not something tied to a personality change seems unreasonable, yet implied, which is kind of annoying.\n\nI'm not doubting the study, but more the implications.\n\nWhat do you think of my perspective?	1346350345

Here's what happened in plan layman's terms: The solar radiation from the CME (coronal mass ejection, aka solar flare) hit dust particles being left in the wake of an extremely hot planet with no atmosphere to keep all the surface dust contained when an meteoroid hits. This dust is being pulled along by the magnetosphere, thus when the solar radiation hit the ionized particles and was refracted through the magnetosphere, we see a phenomenon very similar to what we on earth label an aurora.	1323429202

*\\*sigh*\\* I seem to have taken this thread as my crusade *du jour*. Be that as it may, I might as well proceed.\n\nConsidering that the Norwegian Medical Association is a member or the WMA, I'm pretty sure that you, too, adhere to the principles of the [Declaration of Helsinki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Helsinki) and it's later revisions, that state e.g. that:\n\n*"The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists."*\n\nThis means that controlling with only a placebo - i.e. a sham treatment with no physiological effects - is *unethical* if there is an already effective treatment available. Otherwise, the use of a placebo is only acceptable if the treatment studied is *"for a minor condition and the patients who receive placebo will not be subject to any additional risk of serious or irreversible harm"*. \n\nYou cannot study e.g. a cancer medicine with half of the subjects only getting saline injections - that would be a death sentence to those unlucky enough to be in the control group.\n\nThis doesn't mean that the studies do not take into account the placebo-effect, but that they just do not use an actual placebo.\n\nThere is no need to test each drug against a *bona fide* placebo to determine that it fulfills the effectiveness requirement you mention. If you test against a prevailing treatment you pretty much know already that if you do better than it, you certainly do better than a placebo. Broadly speaking, the success rate requirement only really applies to somewhat suspicious treatments trying to get approval to be called a medicine, like herbal remedies -  e.g. whether [echinacea extracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinacea) can be called medicine or not. Nobody wants to develop a drug that is e.g. overall less effective as a painkiller as ibuprofen - a drug like that would never go into production from economic reasons alone, even if it somehow gained approval (which it wouldn't).\n\nI swear I'm not making this up, these are international treaties and guidelines, to which each individual Medical Association has agreed. Check with your friend, I'm pretty darn sure they'll agree with me.	1326136771

(It's worth noting that the video mostly focuses on the question of safety of artificial sweeteners, not efficacy for weightloss. That doesn't make these points less valid, but is relevant for any redditors wondering what the video is all about.)\n\n&gt; Several large scale prospective cohort studies found positive correlation between artificial sweetener use and weight gain. The San Antonio Heart Study examined 3,682 adults over a seven- to eight-year period in the 1980s [18]. When matched for initial body mass index (BMI), gender, ethnicity, and diet, drinkers of artificially sweetened beverages consistently had higher BMIs at the follow-up, with dose dependence on the amount of consumption.  \n  \nCorrelation, not causation.  I thought I was in /r/skeptic here? I am disapoint.  \n  \nOver-eaters tend to consume a lot of things, including sodas (diet or otherwise). Skinny, health-conscious people avoid sodas (diet or otherwise). Thus, being fat will lead you to drink more sodas (diet or otherwise). Artificial sweeteners might indeed make you fat, but this study does not in any way prove that.\n\n&gt; In addition, consensus from interventional studies suggests that artificial sweeteners do not help reduce weight when used alone [2,25]. BMI did not decrease after 25 weeks of substituting diet beverages for sugar-sweetened beverages in 103 adolescents in a randomized controlled trial, except among the heaviest participants\n\nSwitching to diet soda didn't work...except when **it did work**.\n\n&gt; double blind study subjected 55 overweight youth to 13 weeks of a 1,000 Kcal diet accompanied by daily capsules of **aspartame or lactose placebo**. Both groups lost weight, and the difference was not significant. Weight loss was attributed to caloric restriction\n\nUm...no one is saying that artificial sweeteners miraculously cause weightloss.  I'm pretty sure the claim is that replacing sugar with an artificial sweetener -- assuming all other variables remain static -- will result in reduced caloric intake, which then results in weightloss. Comparing aspartame to a placebo and having both groups lose the same weight in fact suggests that aspartame does NOT lead to weight-gain.\n\n&gt; Similar results were reported for a 12-week, 1,500 Kcal program using either regular or diet soda [28]. Interestingly, when sugar was covertly switched to aspartame in a metabolic ward, **a 25 percent immediate reduction in energy intake** was achieved [29]. \n\nHey, look at that.\n\n&gt; Further, the research in this review indicates that artificial sweeteners do not activate neurological satiety loops in the same way as sucrose, *meaning they actually increase appetite*\n\nNo, the study says they **may** contribute to increased appetite. Sounds like a hypothesis to me, not a conclusion.\n\nAlso, why *should* a zero-calorie drink trigger your full satiation response?  You aren't satiated at all.  Is there any indication that it SUPPRESSES a satiation response, if consumed during a meal?  There's nothing in your excerpt at all. Nothing that supports the idea that artificial sweeteners would lead to binging or cravings.\n\nBTW, the normal pathway (as I understand it) for a satiation response is Grehlin, which is produced by a drop in blood sugar, which normally comes after an insulin response. Artificial sweeteners don't produce an insulin response, which is (one of the reasons?) why that chain fails, which is a GOOD THING -- because an insulin response would:  \n* Lead to an inappropriate fall in blood sugar, resulting in an actual, acute craving  \n* Trigger fat cells to store fat (and to prevent them from releasing energy from fat), which would res  \n	1311965910

I just got of the phone with a buddy of mine who as a biology/general science teacher had some pH test paper lying around. Lemon juice (fresh squeeze) came in at a pH of 2 to 3. Since the chart didn't specify whether it would be just the juice or the lemon as whole he popped half a lemon in a blender and tested it at a pH of about 4. \nThe point you made about distilled water seems to have been sufficiently discussed in the thread you linked to, so I don't see how that justifies your observation that 'there is no scepticism here'.	1339624465

I guess I'm mainly looking at the 2nd box in the first panel ("Because for each thing...").\n\nThe protagonist's choice not to make fun of people comes not from the humility and self-awareness of understanding that he himself does not know many things, but rather the idea that his knowledge is special and obscure and so, gosh, all those regular ol' folks out there can't be expected to know what I know!\n\nIt is entirely possible that I am reading far too much into this and/or projecting and/or misinterpreting and/or need to cut back on coffee.	1336589592
The orwellian use of the word "complementary" has nothing to do with the fact that it complements a primary treatment regimen. Treatments are not singular entities, in the same way that most diseases are not discrete problems with singular etiologies. Alt-med nutters use the word because it makes it seem like they aren't trying to deny the earth is round and revolves around the sun. It's like "intelligent design."	1319521920
Best thing that comes to mind is your camera flash plus the quickness he needed to take the pic caused a bit of a blur. I personally have had that happen on both my iPhone and a regular camera.

That is freaky. There's a Highway that leads up to a place called Genting Highlands in Malaysia. Apparently stuff like this happens pretty often there.

&gt;You are confusing the serious complications from the smallpox study with general complications.\n\nLike I said, I don't know what these complications are.  I'm a physicist.  Please provide me something to work with here.  What is a complication from a vaccine?  I've read a lot of literature about the field, I'm not totally ignorant of vaccines.  But, I'm not sure what you think a "complication" is.  Could you please be more clear about this?  I'm actually genuinely curious.  I'm merely being skeptical of your claims.  I think this is the right subreddit for that, right?\n\nAlso, I never claimed that the US one is better than the European one.  I more or less assume that they are the same until proven otherwise.  I think that burden is on you, not on me.  You're the one claiming that there is a benefit, yet you admit that you have no real evidence of that other than a conversation or so that you've had with people about "complications" that they have had.  I don't know anyone who has had complications from vaccines here in the US.  Could you please explain this to me?	1316112149

I think there's room for both approaches and that both can be persuasive in different ways.  It all depends on who you're trying to convince.

Are you trying to convince the audience to whom this guy is trying to sell his magic water?  Well then making him look like an ass would be one of the easiest ways to convince them. 	1344609702

There is clearly the danger of legitimizing someone's view by accepting to debate them. And perhaps that risk is large enough to warrant declining such a debate.\n\nI do however think it would be hilarious to tackle creationists by arguing them from the point of view of alternative creation standpoints. \n\n"What nonsense! Clearly humanity wasn't created by Cannanite wargod Jahwe, everyone knows full well that Men were created from the vegetable world by the gods Odin, Hoenir and Lodur. One day the three gods were travelling across the barren earth and came across two trees with life-less twisted trunks. Odin shaped each of the trees into a man and a woman, and gave each of them breath. Hoenir gave them a soul and the ability to reason. Lodur gave them warmth and the fresh colours of life. The man was called Ask and his wife was Embla, and they proceeded to create the race of man."\n\nThis is clearly evident if you compare the genetic material of plants and humans, there are clear genetic similarities which point to humans having been created from trees. Silly christians!	1347549731

I believe the story to be true so far as his personality completely changing, but my (completely uninformed) guess is that it didn't actually turn him gay - he was previously homosexual, but forced himself to think he was straight and act accordingly. The stroke could have affected his inhibitions, or robbed him of cognitive resources he had previously devoted to try and suppress his sexuality. \n\nBut who knows; there's evidence that there are not just hormonal, but structural differences in parts of the brains of homosexual versus heterosexual males. Perhaps trauma to certain areas could alter someone's sexual orientation. I really want to see a case study for this. 	1320904069

Thanks for the in depth and thoughtful reply. I'm a bit off my tits at the moment, so please forgive me if my answer appears disjointed. Its refreshing to hear someone from the skeptic community acknowledging that despite the mass of conspiracy data, there will be nuggets of truth with in it. \n\nI think every perspective has a piece of the puzzle.\n\nI dont think its really fair to say the conspiracy community is quite as autonomous to say they all say the same thing - some will say they know the truth, some are asking for the truth - and there is a cross over in data shared between the conspiratorial community and the "secular" crowds, and despite its cultic appearance, the people and the perspectives involved in the conspiracy community are incredibly varied and differ substantially on deeper inspection.\n\nI guess my criticism comes from the appearance that the skeptical community is usually quicker to deride the conspiracies than take a deeper look - but perhaps your answer has helped me consider something else...\n\nPerhaps it's a case of the loudest voices in each camp making noises which risk us making basic assumptions about the groups they represent.\n\nI think the vacuum of truth that comes from a knowing mistrust of official sources, as you've rightly acknowledged in your initial paragraph has created an inadvertent power vacuum for competing perspectives on reality - and the antagonism that exists on both sides is a consequence of this jostling for views in putting the world to rights.\n\nRegardless of the accuracy of perspective held up by either party, (or the perspective dismissed by either) I've sensed having gone through a full-blown "awakening" to the information in myself, that the need to defend it (and ultimately proselytise it) was in part an unrecognised product of doubt I still had in my mind about the information. I'd suggest that the same applies to those in the skeptic community who appear to spend more energy ridiculing the conspiratorial community than having a good hard look at what the data is saying. \n\nAs you say, there is so much we just dont know.\n\nI'm interested in building bridges through these competing perspectives because I often find myself seeing correlation between both sides, having passed through an intense phase of information gathering and becoming quite frankly quite intoxicated by it at times.\n\nNever the less, I've found myself passing through it with a growing sense of ambivalence to both skeptics and conspiratorials alike - it's occurred to me through the process that there are more fruitful and bigger fish to fry than screaming till you're blue in the face with someone doing the same back. It's all interesting information.\n\nI cant find a bigger question than "what is the nature of mind?" these days, and that question has superceded really my entire fascination with the NWO/Conspiracy lore.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for taking time to reply, best wishes and thank you for your efforts dissolving the fence between the camps....maybe it's all about what we identify with at the end of the day.\n\nPeace\n;)	1306623804

This really is the bias test for /r/skeptic\n\nThis sort of submission is why I'm here. We need more critical thought and less circlejerking. \n\nBad studies? Poor methodology? Corruption?

It could be a homeopathic study or a pharmaceutical study. Don't just back up a source uncritically because you like the outcome. That's religion at that point. 	1329827333

You guys were just assholes. There was no call to completely out her and attack her like that. You WERE attacking her for simply posting about a festival, not even HER festival. Seriously, what the fuck? Way to further the terrible circlejerk reputation r/atheism already has on the rest of reddit. Way to fucking respect her right to invite people to something she's interested in. Just because you don't want anything to do with it, does not give you a license to e-thug her to tears. Polite discourse does not involve attacking someone until they're at their wit's end. Not only that, but you are misconstruing the festival itself, the majority of which is Yoga, music, and food. Sounds like a good time honestly.\n\nShutting down her voice because some gullible people might be taken in by a few things the festival (not her) have to offer is akin to that annoying nice guy, white-knight, all-women-are-fragile-flowers bullshit.\n\nFuck you.\n\nYou should apologize to her and for making this additional post.	1298655967

The obnoxiously high amount of contingent variables which led to the development of technological civilization on our planet leaves me doubting that there is any place like Earth with Earth-like beings out there in the universe. I know the universe is big, but given the limited sample size of known instances of life I'm not convinced that there are any good reasons to believe that the evolution of intelligent life has occurred more than once. Even if it did happen, or is going to happen elsewhere, someone has to be first. That could be us.\n\nI'm more partial to possibility of bacteria-like organisms. Given what we know about life as it arose on our own planet it seems a lot more reasonable.

&gt; TIL That during the filming of The Exorcist, many actors were injured, the set burned down, a priest was brought in many times to bless the set, and the actor who played Burke, Jack MacGowran, died from influenza.

Some people don't seem to be able to let their beliefs go because they're so sure the official story is a conspiracy/cover-up.

At the moment, I lack the desire to fully respond to this, but I want you to know that I agree wholeheartedly with you. I believe ET, under the same laws of physics that we experience here, would develop not only similarly to us, but would most likely follow a very direct path along evolution's line. Every creature needs its basic senses. To see, an eye needs to be evolved. To move, appendages. To hear, auditory receptors, etc. \n\nEverything we perceive here, we would undoubtedly be able to perceive on another earth-like planet. After all, we aren't the *only* place in the universe where our laws of physics apply. \n\nPeople are so quick to assume that *we* are the ones who stand out. I for one think we are a very naive and self-absorbed race, and we have a long way to go... Oh what I'd give to just travel the stars and nudge intelligent life along.	1328503053

Both of your assumptions of me are incorrect.  It just seems that every skeptic tries to come up with an immediate invalid explanation.  I apologize, but that display could not possibly be bats or moths.  If you see a plane fly overhead, you can clearly see that it is a plane by the way it behaves: lights, straight balanced flight path, and lack of flapping to create lift.  You can tell it isn't a bird.  That is an observation made based on experience and you see it as fact.  It is how our minds view the world.  If some full grown man sat beside you, pointed at the plane and said "That's a blue jay!" or "That's a moth," you would suspect he is either dicking with you or somehow mentally incompetent.  Or, he simply views the world so very differently.  Either way, you can tell the difference between a plane and a bird.  I, and people not clouded by complete skepticism or a lack of knowledge, can tell you with %100 certainty that the objects in those videos(regardless if it was sky divers, extra terrestrial life, or a government test ship)that those objects were not moths or bats by the way they appear and behave due to our knowledge of the observable universe.	1333068376

This is why he says we, and all we create, are nature. Everything in the past has led us to where we are now.\n\nI'm fond of the idea that our "consciousness" is actually us in the 4th dimension, and we are like a slug, composed of all states of our life from birth to death. I always kept the idea of us separate though, you are one slug, and I am another slug. His metaphor about the hand passing through the second dimension was really eye opening to me. I know the concept of a 3d object passing through a 2d plane, but to think we are all just fingertips of a larger hand connected in a higher dimension is awesomely comforting.

&gt;From what I've read, acupuncture has statistically significant results for some conditions - mostly relief of pain.\n\nI haven't read any peer reviewed, methodologically stringent study (eg. properly blinded, randomized, large N, etc.) that showed acupuncture had any effect that differed significantly from acupuncture placebo/sham groups.  In other words, the studies (so far) illustrate that the efficacy of acupuncture are easily attributable to the placebo effect.  If you know of studies that say otherwise, do share.\n\n&gt;Acupuncture is a poor choice for the author to be critical of here because it has statistical significance above sugar pill placebo, relieving some instances of chronic pain where other treatments did not help.\n\nI have read about some interesting studies done recently that show that non-invasive or small placebos differ in effect compared to larger or invasive placebos (I haven't read the studies as of yet, so I cannot say that these differences were significant, or that they were significant).  Ben Goldacre just did an interesting TED talk where he described such a graded placebo effect: with regard to placebo "efficacy", small sugar pill &lt; large sugar pill &lt; salt water (saline) injection.  This is suggestive that placebos that are perceived by the patient as being more invasive tend to have a greater effect than those that are perceived as less invasive.  But be mindful that we are still comparing placebos to placebos, and this evidence does not yet validate or justify placebos as being used as bona-fide medical treatments, especially for serious conditions.  Also be mindful that such results are new, as we are just starting to dig into (with science, that is) what the placebo effect is and how it actually works.\n\nThat said, Novella is not declaring that placebo is bunk (his very first sentence implies the opposite).  Rather, he is saying that people have a poor understanding of what the placebo effect is, and what it is not, and we should be careful claims that exploit this ignorance.  He is also illustrating exactly why we should be wary of anecdotal claptrap (take a look at what ranza is serving up, for instance).	1317569721

Those are both just mp3s I opened with audacity. The top was obviously digitally mastered and distributed because that's the only way to get the sound so uniformly loud (That's not the point though because it would sound just as bad if the same thing was done with analog equipment). The bottom is a rip of a 70's record, though it could have easily been done digitally today. \n\nI would have no problem with the loudest sound wave hitting 0db; the problem comes when you amplify every part of the song to make it as loud as it can possibly be because that flattens out the song and makes it sound like garbage, regardless of how good the song really is. Bands and labels do it at the expense of sound quality because they don't want anybody else to be louder than them, and the music industry is still failing (not that I'm implying causation). Many classic bands are re-releasing their old albums with this mastering. I have Black Sabbath's original records (as mp3s) and also their remastered versions of the same songs (also as mp3s with the same bit rate as the mp3s of the originals). The originals sound great but the remasters sound terrible. 	1343570987

First off, check the usernames.  I'm not SaoJoao, the person who said the things you are arguing against.  I'm the third party that read the thread and saw where some of the confusion was coming from.\n\n\n\nSecond,  I understand that you are trying to "prove that it happens."  The problem is that that is completely meaningless - something happening and something being likely or probable are completely different, which is why anecdotal evidence is ignored.  If you want to show that fraud or misdiagnosis is likely or the most plausible explanation, it would serve you better to provide statistics, hard numbers, or solid studies on the prevalence of these events, instead of individual anecdotes of times you've seen it happen.  I've seen a computer with a mouse nest inside of it, but that doesn't mean I assume that's the cause every time I see a computer crash - I check for the statistically more likely causes before the one I've anecdotally encountered.\n\n\n\nThird, I'm not sure if it's intentional, but I feel your tone is coming off as somewhat abusive and insulting, which is unwanted and unhelpful.  Sorry if I've misread you in that regard; text can be unclear at times.	1323368708

You, OP....are a curious individual but sometimes hesitant to ask questions, as they sometimes get you in trouble. You're affable, but often hold part of yourself back, seldom comfortable revealing your entire self even to the people you love. Speaking of love, your love life has occasionally been a challenge and you have had occasional trouble meeting or even fully understanding your sexual desires. You consider yourself a largely rational person, but your emotions may play more of a role in your thinking than you are sometimes comfortable with. You have suffered financial difficulties in the past, and know what it's like to struggle to make ends meet, but that's changing with time and you have a bright financial future ahead.\n\nHow am I doing so far?  ;)	1338860192

Nowhere do they quote her as saying that she wants to prove the doctors wrong by demonstrating that alternative cures work; nothing that she says even remotely resembles that sentiment.  In addition to continuing chemotherapy per her doctors' orders, she's also pursuing alternative treatments, and that's all there is to this story.  That fact alone is utterly unremarkable.  As a true skeptic, I would try alternative treatments unless reliable studies had concluded that they do not help at all, and many of the treatments she's trying have not been studied.  If modern science is telling her she's definitely going to die relatively soon, then I think it's completely rational for her to try treatments which have not yet been deemed ineffective by science, even if they end up hastening her death.\n\nThe only thing she says which expresses disagreement with her doctors is that she believes that their estimation of the time she had left before death was inaccurate, which apparently it was. \n\nThis submission is stupid.	1339302363

&gt;How can this community pretend to be skeptics but believe blindly in global warning?\n\nThat's because we don't blindly believe in it, rather we accept it is very likely to be true (and very unlikely to be false) given the compelling empirical evidence supporting it, as well as the lack of evidence against it.\n\n&gt;The whole idea of being a skeptic is being skeptical of everything.\n\nTo be skeptical does not mean to doubt everything, all the time, it means not believing things that aren't supported by evidence.\n\nDoubting everything all the time quickly makes life unlivable.\n\nhttp://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism\n\n&gt;I could just as easily post a link saying ' energy band denier mis-reports facts about energy bands', shouldn't we be skeptical about both sides?\n\nOne isn't skeptical of a "side."

As has already been mentioned it's Adam Curtis' documentary "The power of Nightmares" which aired on BBC 2 in 2004 (according to Wikipedia).\n\nIn terms of how credible it is, i would also be interested in other opinions on this. His documentaries are definitely not considered "fringe" and he's not an Alex Jones or anything and although his documentaries have an editorial tone he backs everything up with facts, references and tons of archival footage (not a plus in the "should i believe him" column but makes for very good documentary films).\n\nI find Adam Curtis to be pretty trustworthy factually and most criticisms are attacking his ideology or politics (perfectly reasonable but subjective judgements).\n\nWhen looking up that air date on Wikipedia I found out that he called Michael Moore "a political agitprop film-maker" which made me like him more, although doesn't affect his credibility obviously.\n\nedit: I didn't mention that the person who posted this clip (sans context) to Youtube with the headline "BBC Now Admits AL Qaeda Never Existed" is an idiot	1299112851

I have vivid and lucid dreams very often, which I guess is different than astral projection, because I am aware I am dreaming but usually don't have good control and my thought is slugglish. Typically once I know I'm dreaming I start 1. flying around 2. conjuring a hot guy up to have sex with. Not even kidding, it always happens. I even have a "check" in my dreams to tell if I'm dreaming. I either "hover" above the ground or walk through walls/ceilings. Last night I kept hovering over the ground to convince my friend that I didn't actually hit his car and that I was dreaming him and the whole situation up. Weird.\n\nAnyway, wanna know my fool proof tip for starting lucid sleep? Go to bed. Wake up about two hours before you normally get up, then go back to sleep. I always have extremely vivid or lucid dreams when I do this. Another tip is to "check" if you're dreaming during your waking life, like, every time you touch a doorknob, ask yourself "is this a dream?" Eventually you will do this in your dreams. I started doing this way back when I was a teen and I'm pretty sure that's why I have such crazy dreams now. Also, certain foods tend to help, lots of dairy or spicy food can affect your dreams. I know you're asking about AP but learning to control your dreams is pretty awesome.	1343939130

The alternative seems to be to believe every claimant that comes along without using a shred of critical thinking. \n\nThis destroys the community altogether by undermining the research effort's credibility with anyone who doesn't believe the subject, and removing the possibility of actually discovering the truth. To do the latter you actually have to use critical thinking to separate truth from fiction. \n\nThe UFO research community is full of hoaxers and the deluded. They are holding back discovering the truth. Let's get rid of them. What's the problem with that? 	1348630926

The problem is that meaning opf 'conspiracy' has been distorted over time to have connotation of being some sort of global thing. In fact, conspiracies do happen all the time. They happen any time a small group of people get together to secretly do something If you don't believe that people, in fairly large numbers on the planet, form agreement between two or more others to break the law or take some sort of covert against someone or something else at some future point, then you're not paying attention to how people are.	1346350020

This is a nice list but I would be interested in learning more about why and how these orbs manifest. Specifically, I have always been amazed by the "blue pearl" that is sometimes associated with spiritual development and some meditative states. I have seen these orbs before in purple and red colors as well, but had always considered them to be "spirtual" phenomena. My initial belief was that orbs are more traditionally associated with ghosts and other paranormal phenomena, but maybe that isn't always the case?	1324064373

The something imbalance hypothesis is just today's manifestation of old thinking fallacy (recall all the woo concerning imbalance in life force).\n\nThe brain is much more complicated. You can have not enough *receptors* for instance. Then you can take a totally unnatural drug that is in totally unnatural way blocking the re-uptake of neurotransmitters that latch to those receptors, resulting in totally unnatural imbalance between its production and removal, and then you'll feel better. \n\nOr you can have low connection strength somewhere upstream of that, or you may simply live in a rather depressing environment, or anything. Either way this re-uprate inhibitor will get you feeling better. So will a sugar pill if you think it helps, and it will be almost as effective.\n\nThere's nothing per-se wrong with totally unnatural solutions, except the marketing perspective. For marketing it is far better to say that there is some balance that is off, which is being made right by the drugs. To equate mood with chemicals and to make you form a mental model of something like diabetes. \n\nBottom line is, we do not understand disorders like depression, and we treat them by prescribing drugs that have opposite (mood lifting) effect. That's it. The same thing we'd do 1000 years ago - recommend 'em some euphoric drug (we didn't have double blind trials back then but we sure knew what the psychoactive drugs were). The chemical imbalance is the sales pitch, the same pitch medicine sellers have been making from long before we figured out what chemical elements were. If someone has a problem you don't understand, and your medicine solves it, the best pitch you can ever make is that your medicine is correcting things to normal. Now this sales pitch is outdated - we have a glimpse of the immense complexity of the issue which does not admit any chemical imbalance model.\n\nedit: better article detailing how it is primarily just a sales pitch and public image rather than an accepted hypothesis per se: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/99356.php	1348729270
I couldn't agree more and it's a shame. It would be borderline impossible to   keep the public's faith after something like that but it could be quite advantageous.

I don't see how ["Two wrongs make a right"](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/two-wrongs-make-a-right.html) is necessarily a logical fallacy since "right" and "wrong" are not defined in concrete terms. I'm not saying that two wrongs can make a right, merely that without defining a moral framework you can't claim it to be a logical fallacy. I wouldn't be shocked to hear of a conception of right and wrong where "two wrongs make a right" might apply even if I don't subscribe to it. The conception of morality in terms of justice via punishment for example has a similar sentiment. You could define morality in terms of "treating others as they treat others" as well, and while I may not agree I can certainly see right and wrong defined in such terms. The difficult part would be making it apply as a general rule, but the examples stated on the page don't even allow for "two wrongs can make a right under conditions X, Y, Z."\n\n:Cue appeals to authority to prove me wrong.:	1283193097

Wrong. That's not science. When conducting a scientific investigation you gather evidence and then form conclusions. If you're wanting imagination to drive research then you invariably end up creating conclusions and then gathering evidence to support them. That's where ufology has gone wrong.

Honestly, a sliced piece of garlic placed in my ear worked for me on a couple of occasions. I know that's not scientific, but I swear it did. I was skeptical but desperate the first time I tried, and all I can guess is that the fumes put out by the cut end of the garlic must have somehow interfered with the swelling or the nerves or something. To be clear, it quickly stopped hurting - in about 10 - 15 minutes after hurting for a few hours.

Of course! What you just said is fairly scientific, actually. You can't rule anything out, but you must be honest about probabilities, and how new discoveries affect said probabilities. If evidence for one thing continues to shrink the possibility of another thing, you have to take it into account. If the evidence is undeniable, then you have to accept the change in thinking and accept that you were wrong in order to remain honest. That's all. Galileo disproved Aristotle's ideas on momentum. Einstein vastly improved upon Newton's laws of motion. After we discovered the electromagnetic spectrum, the use of radiation gave us a much more accurate age of the Earth. Part of honest inquiry about the universe is knowing when you're wrong, and moving forward.	1344025610

Sorry, didn't even bother to read the comments to the post. I generally don't to posts like that one as there is really little comment about. Its a good quote and I left it at that. The fact it was x-post from r/atheism made it a bit annoying as I really hate that subreddit.	1346339624
of course testimonials can reflect truth but they can never mean anything on their own compared to the efficacy of say double-blind. the simple fact there is no control variable should raise red alarms for finding truth in anything.\n\nthere are a ton of skeptics who are very critical of the pill popping industry (watch Ben Goldacre's TED talk) , and no one will argue doctors are always honest or that their institutions are infallible. that still doesn't mean that people should get away with promoting alternative treatments with such confidence and conviction when they have no real information to back it up. usually they've been unable or are unwilling to do the testing to prove it and just resort to more theatrics to engage peoples' emotions like we see in these documentaries.	1329260511

A few things things, since all of them are pretty crazy. I'll separate them by the houses they occurred in with dashed lines.\n\nWhen I was about 9 years old, we finally got a computer and internet working. Since all my gaming equipment was on the bottom floor of the house, the computer was also stored there. Note that my room was also on the bottom floor of the house, that my room had no windows, and that the only way into my room was the door we built to it a little before buying the computer. One day, I'm surfing the internet when suddenly I hear someone banging and screaming from behind my bedroom door, trying to get out. I was frozen in my seat, and I didn't know what to do. I just sat there and listened as I heard something like a woman with very high pitched screaming banging on my door. When I realized what was going on, I ran upstairs to find my father giving my little brother a bath, as if they didn't hear anything. I never brought it up to them. \n\nI also remember eating dinner with my family upstairs, when I heard all my toys downstairs crash. The toys were in a huge container that definitely could not be tipped over. My grandma told me to ignore the sound. \n\nWhen my grandma would get a babysitter for my brothers and I, she would always tell the babysitters to never let my little brother look at the kitchen light downstairs, and that if the kitchen stove downstairs turned itself on, then to ignore it. My little brother was never allowed to look at the kitchen light, because his nose would bleed profusely every single time. For the kitchen stove? The dials would turn themselves, even though they were the kind you had to push in to turn. \n\n------------------\n\nWhen I moved to Minnesota, my family bought a huge house for really cheap. At the time, I had no idea how we got it so cheap. When we finally settled in, my mom bought two couches and a TV, and put them in the downstairs living room. At the time, Adult Swim was new, so I would stay up and watch it every night. However, one night, I hear someone open the laundry room door behind me. Now, nobody was awake at the time since it was late, and if anybody were to come downstairs, they would have to open the door that led upstairs, which I shut. My brothers were sleeping in their rooms down the hall from me, and I would have definitely heard them opening their doors since their doors were very heavy. Back to the laundry room door opening, I was freaking out. I looked back and saw that the laundry door was open. Then, I heard something opening and shutting the washer and dryer doors, and it sounded like it was also just unrelentingly slamming on the sides of them. This went on for what seemed like ages, and I remember that I just started sweating like crazy because I didn't know what to do. I don't remember falling asleep that night, and I woke up still wet from sweat. I think I fainted from being so freaked out by the noises. I'll never forget that night. \n\nLater, my family learned that there was a teenage girl who was shot to death in the hallway downstairs before we moved in. \n\nTL;DR - Lived in haunted houses. Shit happened. 	1336037129

She absolutely does, though she was healthy when I first knew her. It's an issue of personality susceptibility - just like there are predispositions to become an alcoholic, but no one is born an alcoholic. In this case the susceptibility to paranoid delusions really starts to manifest in the person's attitude towards the first conspiracy videos they encounter: are they agonizing over it, spending a lot of time doing research, and talking to everyone/trying to convince everyone about it? Does it become one of the most important things in their life? The behaviours surrounding the belief are cause for concern, more so than the belief itself.\n\nIt's still not cut and dry - some people just go through phases where they get really interested in something, but abandon it later. What I think I learned, and wanted to pass on, is that its very easy to dismiss the signs of delusional paranoia right up until it's too late to do anything about it. Because it alters your perception, it is very difficult for paranoids to recognize their own illness, and so early intervention on the part of a concerned friend or family member may be the only hope they have (much as we all hate being paternalistic towards our fellows).	1315762108
Honestly mostly photo editing, but I imagine it could do anything I wanted it to if I tried. I've actually just switched over to using light room recently on this computer, I used the free trial for CS for a while (I had CS 5), and I didn't really use any features that light room didn't also have.  I do nature photography, so a lot of the features on CS were just REALLY expensive playing around toys.  I try to limit my manipulation.  I'm sure I'll probably buy CS 6 in the future, just not going to pull the trigger until I feel it's worth it.  I've used the free trial on 3 PC's just to see how it worked though and it did fine (including some playing around time, so not just adjusting exposure etc).    \n\nMy desktop was actually built for mid-end gaming instead of photography, so I don't really know if that makes  a difference.  It has no problem supporting my obscene 30" 2560 X 1600 screen though.  Specs: AMD Radeon HD 6800 X2 (crossfire), dell U3011 monitor (as I said obscenely big, but relatively affordable and it does the job), i5 processor (2500K CPU @ 3.30GHz) and an MSI motherboard (though don't know what type).  I'm sure there are other interesting things I could list, but my x built me this computer and I sort of just told him do it for under 1500 and have a grand ol' time.  It does the trick for pretty much everything I want to do. The only thing I would add to this computer (right now, someday I may want an uber graphics card) is a solid state drive, I should have ignored my X when he said they wern't worth it my new laptop has one and it is fabulous.  I personally hate the idea of all that top down stuff with macs, but I can really see how some people would love it.  I have no problem with people using a mac, and for many people it's what makes sense for them, I'm just saying that you can build a desktop for relatively cheep to your own needs.  I'm sure if I had built this desktop specifically for video editing, it probably wouldn't have been that much more expensive (no clue what you need, but honestly unless I get some sort of uber graphics card apple doesn't even offer, I can't see it being that costly).   At the same time, I would probably never buy a premade PC desktop either.  My laptops have all been pretty expensive , though probably with a bit better specs than equivalently priced macs, my last two were a think pad ( the best part about my think pad was that no one would ever steal it because it looked like it was shipped straight from 1995, despite being a brand new $2000 computer) and an alienware (yes I know I over paid, but  it's pretty and stuff... I hate myself for saying that).\n\nI like to tease my parents about macs all the time, but I honestly have no problem with them, I just hate the idea that somehow they will magically make you a better artist or other silliness.  I know people who buy macs specifically for photo editing... with PS elements.  It's silly, yes macs are great, but if the only reason you buy them is so you can do basic photo editing that can be done on a machine for $1000 less it's silly.    My sister LOVES her macbook air.  It's tiny, it fits in her purse, it weighs next to nothing, and it allows her to surf the internet, sync with her iphone and pretty much never to think about her computer system, and that's fricking great for her.  My brother and I would hate it, as well as a friend who uses extremely user unfriendly linux OS's but for my sister and the rest of my family it is great. I hate syncing, I like files and windows and folders and all that old school windows stuff.  I am a huge fan of the drag and drop.  I like to be able to fool around  with the guts and nastiness easily.  And I know this isn't really an issue anymore, but dammit if I want porn on my phone, I should be able to get a damn porn app.  I don't have a porn app on my android, but knowing that I COULD have a porn app made me happy. \n\n	1341542758
Tell her you never put much stock in fortunetelling.  If they say the future looks bright, that doesn't mean anything unless you do your part.  If they say the future looks bleak, that doesn't mean anything either, because you'll face each challenge as it comes, and decide for yourself how bad it was after you've come through it.\n\nMaybe you do have a destiny, but that doesn't solve your problems today of living your life as best you know how.  I live *today*, learning what lessons I can from the past, and making what plans I think best for the future.  And whatever that future holds, what I have in front of me right now is *today*, and that's what I take care of.\n\nIf some astrologer gave me advice that was anything other than what you can read in *Tao Te Ching*, or the Sermon on the Mount, or *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, or *How to Stop Worrying and Start Living*, or the Book of Proverbs, it's probably not advice worth following.  And if they just give common sense advice, my grandma already did that for me.	1301422640

&gt;&gt;There’s nothing about the dramatic increase in weather-related catastrophes worldwide:\n\n&gt;Which are easily attributable to the change in what is deemed a \nweather-related catastrophe.\n\n&gt;&gt;There’s no mention of the increase in declared disasters in the U.S.:\n\n&gt;Same\n\nYou actually sort of have a point there, if what you're saying is actually true.  I'd like to go back and look at all the disasters that were declared during the period of this graph and see if there really is a lower threshold and, if so, what would the new graph look like if some recent disasters had not been included.  I'd also try maybe going back and including previous storms that were not counted, but honestly I don't know how to do that since some of that information might be hard for me to gather.  I'll give it a try that way as well if I can, but first I am going to see if someone already has.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on where the line should be drawn as to what to include or not include?  I'll be totally up front here and admit that I full expect you to shift the goal posts if you dislike the outcome, so I want us to actually commit to a level of proof that will satisfy both of us beforehand.\n\nEdit: So far I found this: http://www.grida.no/graphicslib/detail/trends-in-natural-disasters_a899#\n\nAs you can see, it does conclude that other factors are increasing the rate of reports of these incidents apart from climate change, but things that would be attributable to climate change are increasing at a rate much faster than earthquakes, which would not be.

Thanks for your agreement on my points. \n\nI'm curious to know how can you tell if the parties conducting the research are impartial or not, because I can't and I would definitely love to learn how to. \n\nWell, even though the existence of acupoints still cannot be scientifically proven (just like [gravity](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Has_gravity_been_proven)), there are studies which show the effect of acupoint stimulation on the limbic system (as mentioned in my original post), and this is one way of explaining why EFT works. What do you think about that?\n\nI am definitely looking forward to the day when there are large, reliable studies on EFT conducted and made known to the public. Personally, I have experienced so many good things with EFT that it seems like a waste to me that not more people know about it. 	1343118360

Alright, I think we're going in circles now. I already mentioned 3 comments ago I understand your point about just b/c all theories are exhausted that it doesn't automatically makes the remainder the default answer. I get it: The Appeal to Ignorance.\n\nHowever, there is still something to be said about this... b/c again, it was either an inside job, or it wasn't.\n\nAnd, as I said before there is evidence of implosions, specifically w/ bldg 7 given how it collapsed in a equilateral motion and that the only way this could have occured is if *all* the column supports were *simultaneously* collapsed... also, thermate evidence.\n\nSo, it's not just a matter of eliminating theories, but also how there's direct evidence of an actual implosion (not my words, words of structural engineers).\n\nedit: in short, one has to weigh the evidence. On one scale you have the explosive theory, which is quite heavily weighed with evidence and on the other scale, you have basically zero evidence for the plane and/or fire theory.  When one objectively weighs the scales, it simply weighs in favour of the explosive theory.	1324949177

We have a **CHRISTIAN** (wtf?) radio station that has a weekly program where [a local "psychic"](http://www.thealbanynewyorkpsychic.com/) does readings for people. "Must know Mondays" or something like that. She's not very good. A couple of highlights:\n\n* A woman called in asking if she'd meet someone (for a relationship) soon. The psychic asked her if she worked in a college, said that she got an impression of tall buildings around the caller, and said it'd be someone the caller met at work. The caller worked in the infirmary at a prison. The psychic said "prison, college, what's the difference, right? AAHAHAHAHAHHAA"\n* A man whose wife died two years ago called in to ask if she was still somewhere near him. He said that he still visits her grave **twice a day** and hasn't thrown away anything of hers from their house. The psychic said she was still around and that the man needed to try to get in touch with her. (WTF. Dude's severely emotionally damaged from his wife dying. You're an asshole.)\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been tempted to call in several times with a fake story about a nonexistent dead relative to see how it'd work out, but I'm not that much of an asshole and I've got shit to do during the day.	1320733717

clinically significant means it has a noticeable effect which this does but only over nothing not sham, look at [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Standard_deviation_diagram.svg) and suppose it represents all the results for back pain after sham acupuncture, with the peak representing the average and also the majority of cases.\n\nnow look at the 1 and -1 at the bottom, those are 1 standard deviation from the mean. Now imagine an identical bell curve over the top of that one but centre its peak 0.23 to the left of the first peak. you would see that there are two distinct peaks (significance) but that they aren't very far from each other (standard deviation).\n\nHence there is a difference but a very small one from the sham . in osteoarthritis and headache the SD from the mean was only 0.15 and 0.16. but a noticeable, aronud SD = 0.5,  difference from nothing.\n\nThis study does say Acupuncture is better than nothing, but about as clinically significant as the sham acupuncture, which a skeptic could easily agree with, if you had an option between nothing and acupuncture i'd go the acupuncture.	1347410001

While it is true that every _argument_ must be judged on its own merits and doing otherwise is fallacious, _claims of fact_ are not subject to the same requirements.

No - it doesn't. They are very close. I see you deny objective morality by saying in order to be moral, you have to have belief. But morality deals with right and wrong. As Wikipedia defines it:\n\n&gt;Morality (from the Latin moralitas "manner, character, proper behavior") is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are good (or right) and those that are bad (or wrong)\n\nThe question here is are morals subjective (meaning our thoughts, feelings, etc. control it and will differ from everyone else's) or objective (meaning are these universal truths based on reality that stay constant no matter what we think). I argue that no matter what you may think, feel, or say, there is a right answer, the ultimate right answer, true no matter what, and that everything else is wrong. Some less wrong than others, but still wrong because it is not the ultimate right/good thing to do. 	1341336664

Some background:\n\nQ&amp;A is an Australian TV show where members of the audience ask questions of politicians, media personalities and subject matter experts on a range of issues.\n\nThe man the question was asked of is Peter Garret who used the be the Environment minister and is now Education minister (also used to be lead singer of midnight oil).\n\nThe show is broadcast live and shows a twitter feed during the show.	1331295439

I understood what you meant, I just disagree. I mean, there are probably some races like that, but others...well, we just can't assume that much about their nature. Perhaps they developed all that ability just *so* they could conquer, rape, and pillage. Maybe their just a mindless swarm with no real introspection other than to spread. Maybe their sense of joy is derived from hunting. There may just simply be some things that are rare in the universe and worth coveting and fighting for.\n\nI understand that it's natural to think of advanced beings as enlightened beings, but I genuinely do think there is danger in ascribing human attributes to the unknown. Some things can grow without the light.	1345192163

No, not really.  There are two main "divisions" within anarchism.\n\n* The Anarcho-Socialists tend to believe money, property, capital, rent, and employment are evil (or something like that, they're hard to understand).  They also believe in democracy and redistribution of wealth ....  hopefully I'm not misrepresenting their POV.\n* The Anarcho-Capitalists tend to adhere to prefer the (a) non-aggression principle and (b) property rights, and many within the Austrian School of Economics (Such as Rothbard) are Anarcho-Capitalists.  Also note that AnCaps use "Capitalism" in the classic free-market sense.	1313575641
Having both been to AA meetings and been in a homeless shelter, I found the similarities were striking.  In both cases, you were expected to accept God, or you weren't fully accepted into the group.  In both cases you had to attend group meeting to talk about your problems.  In both cases, you had to do "humbling" menial labor like clean the coffee maker or sweep the floor.\n\nBottom line is, they both resemble typical traditional Christian proselytizing of the poor or oppressed.	1321671673

1. What is her opinion on religion? I imagine that the truth is vastly different from current day interpretations of Iron Age mythology.\n\n2. Whether there is a god or several gods or nothing at all, it seems there is still a hierarchy of sorts in the afterlife with entities that seem to project their authority over other spirits - at least that's what I presumed from reading NDE/OBE stories ("Do you want to die now or do you want to go back to your life?" or "Hey! Get back into your body!"). Can you elaborate further on this?	1343765415
He gives a good illusion of being logical. The reality is that he has a really strong tendency to base his decisions on the cultural atmosphere he surrounds himself with. At that point he'll use logic in defense of the already decided issue. But only to a certain extent. He'll debate it, but as a debate. And not as an attempt to actually examine the issue. \n\nHe's a really funny, really smart, guy who provides an example that intelligence and education don't always mean understanding of scientific methodology. 	1279246573
Science isn't about war, you calmly explain the facts and if the person you are discussing with is open to it he/she will accept it, if not then too bad.\n\nYelling and screaming is not what scientists should do nor should anyone who seriously wants to promote fact above fiction should ever do. If you feel compelled to get angry and go into pointless arguments then you are really no better than denialists.	1265535020

Bare in mind that most of the time when we're talking about alternative medicine we're talking about practices that have been tested, often extensively, and show no results.  \n\nAs to the holistic approach to medicine, you are absolutely right.  There's nothing wrong with the term holistic in itself, but it has been co-opted by people who are not trained medical practitioners.  \n\nI'm sure that there are many doctors out there who take pride in treating people in a "holistic" manner.  But there is no licencing for "holistic healers".  I could set up a shop and call myself a holistic therapist right now, and be happily stuffing interesting things into even more interesting orifices in no time.	1298936523

To Kurzweil's credit, a great deal of his success as an inventor is owed to his ability to, at the very least, see short-term future innovations down the road.  He began development of his reading machine before the technology to make it possible had been fully-formed.  Likewise his digital keyboard began development ahead of the tech curve so that it was able to come out the moment the tech was ready for it.\n\nThere are a lot of angles you can attack his ideas about The Singularity from, not the least of which being over-optimistic about the likely speed of development.  But when one compares a modern smart-phone to the computing technology used during the Apollo 11 mission, one can't help but marvel at how fast this shit is moving.  Upon getting my iPhone 4s last year, I was taken aback by how much talking to "Siri" felt like speaking to the deck computer from Star Trek.  (And Siri is very much one of the predictions that Kurzweil nailed.  He thought it would be on "PCs", but he also thought there would be tiny PCs that we would carry around with us at all times, using wireless communications as well as voice control.  That's a pretty damn perfect description of my current phone.) \n\nAnyone performing a thought-exercise of looking at current research in quantum computing, cybernetics, high-speed networking, and fabrication robotics, would find it hard to avoid arriving at similar end-games to what Kurzweil is talking about.  He might be a little over-optimistic about how long some of this will take, but most of the ways we're likely to improve technology, including biotech, are probably not far from what's coming.	1353089047
I appreciate your apology, and I appreciate your thoughts.  \n\nMy wife, as a midwife, attends peer review once a month.  As a naturopath, she's required to fill continuing ed credits just like any other medical practitioner, and is under the governance of a state-certified licensing board. \n\nShe became a naturopathic doctor and a midwife because she was interested in the *practice* of healthcare, not the *business* of healthcare.  Her practice allows her to spend much, much more time with her patients and focus on increasing their wellness, rather than getting 15 minutes to prescribe this drug or that.  Not that there aren't any number of conditions that should be treated with prescription medicine - but that so many of the chronic conditions that lower quality of life really respond best to diet, exercise and counseling.\n\nThe problem she faces - **all the time** - is that most people interested in "alternative medicine" have fundamentally given up on allopathic care.  They're the ones who know in their heart of hearts that vaccines give you autism, fillings cause brain damage and that [laying on hands](http://www.naet.com/) will cure your ills.  And frankly, you *have* to get a little woo with them just to get them to listen to you - I got to discuss anal swabs over dinner last night because my wife is trying to get her partner to swap over to a more accurate hepatitis test and her partner doesn't even really believe in *germ theory*.  Meanwhile, most people on the Western side of things think that anyone telling you to get more sleep, eat better and get some exercise so that you can stop taking blood pressure medication is a charlatan and a witch out to drain your bank account.\n\nI dunno.  It just gets tiresome defending one side to the other every day and then getting pilloried by both of them.  Your viewpoint is diminishingly rare.\n\n	1279936953
I like the story of that one military officer that touched the craft in Rendlesham Forest, and got some kind of flash of a bunch of binary that he couldn't understand.

That is the kinda thing that gives me goosebumps, a completely reasonable and mundane piece of information that a craft would have on it. 	1337952668

I'm not so sure (no expert here), if proteins were fully destroyed by the digestive process, there would be no such thing as food allergy, right?  Peanuts, eggs, milk, wheat, and so forth, all allergies to proteins that the body finds within as foreign.  \n\nPerhaps instead of 'all', we should consider that some portion is making it through the digestive process.  Now, what comprises an effective dose is hard to say, but if kids can die from minute quantities of peanut, I wouldn't expect much colostrum to be necessary to register with our immune systems.	1311355922
Transcript [here](http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/)\n\n&gt;On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.\n\nThis can be broken up into a few assertions:\n\n* A plane cannot be hijacked with box cutters - Sure it can.  Why couldn't it be?\n* Al-Qaeda isn't organized enough to carry out such an attack - They sure as shit are organized.  And the "caves" they they live in aren't so much caves as they are literally vast underground fortresses.\n* If it were a legitimate terrorist attack, then jets would have been scrambled immediately. - Fairly thoroughly debunked [here](http://conspiracies.skepticproject.com/articles/911/norad/) \n\n&gt;These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, \n\nIrrelevant\n\n&gt;managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground,\n\nDebunked [here](http://conspiracies.skepticproject.com/articles/911/hijackers/page/2/#hanisucks)\n\n&gt;hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.\n\n\nDebunked [here](http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html)\n\n&gt;Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.\n\nNot even sure what he's trying to say here.  There was speculation about the perpetrators in the beginning, and intelligence agencies said it was most likely a terrorist attack.  Can someone chime in and tell me why this is relevant?\n\n&gt;The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish.\n\n\nDebunked [here](http://other.skepticproject.com/articles/quotes/view/27/911-commission-member-said-commission-was-setup-t/)\n\n&gt; It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed.\n\nWhat about the people who claimed responsibility while they were halfway around the world, not being tortured?\n\n&gt; It failed to mention the existence of WTC7\n\n\nDebunked [here](http://www.debunking911.com/pull.htm)\n\n&gt; Able Danger\n\nDebunked [here](http://conspiraciesrnotus.blogspot.com/2007/12/dismantling-able-danger.html)\n\nHonestly, I'm getting tired of this.  All of the shit he said has been thoroughly debunked.  He just dressed it up in satire and made his assertions even more ambiguous.  There is nothing new to see here, except a slightly higher production value in the crazy people videos than normal.  	1331094543

It's an interesting critique after you've seen the talk (which goes over the major points in the book).	1309559655

And if we are to eliminate the known fundamental laws of physics in the conversation, then where does one draw the line between realistic vs. unrealistic hypotheses? If we were writing a science fiction novel, then I would absolutely agree! But we're not. We're talking about the real world, and I don't know if there's value considering possibilities that aren't known to be possible in the real world. Know what I mean here? We have to work within the framework of what we know, not what we don't know.	1345051289
It's more likely that every UFO "sighting" was hallucinated or misinterpreted than the idea that we are being visited by intelligent extra-terrestrial beings.

Don't get me wrong, I don't disagree with you.  The issue isn't that government wants/doesn't want to control birth rates and such, because they often do, but that the current debate on marriage and associated rights doesn't have much (if anything) to do with government's desire for that birth rate.\n\n&gt; Government control of marriage is actually a pretty ineffective way to encourage procreation.\n\nIt depends on how you view it.  Having a codified system could be good, in the sense that contract enforcement helps businesses be able to deal with one another.  The 'extra layer' may help create the conditions that allow people to raise children in extra safety or whatever.  My comment should only be taken in the context that making absolute statements (government does not want to, government does not help) weakens the overall argument.\n\nFundamentally the argument is flawed because gay and lesbians probably won't have kids outside of marriage, but could (at the very least) raise kids in marriage.  Allowing them the same rights would increase their ability to 'have' children, either by proxy, adoption or some other means.	1335475134

Most likely he'll come out of it disillusioned by religion in general. So, don't worry about it. Give it another five years, then *start* to worry if things haven't changed.	1288736449

My reaction was so funny when I found SGU. I was like, "Wait, I'm a skeptic? You mean there are other people in the world like me?"\n\nI felt an instant bond because I finally found a group of people who I could identify with.

The problem is that if they are able to somehow come to the conclusion that evolution, a scientific theory that has only been bolstered by every bit of evidence ever found, never called into question by any kind of legitimate evidence (there *is no* "contraversy,* and no biologist worth his weight in salt would say otherwise), and is in fact observable in our every day lives (virus mutation, breeding of dogs, speciation occurring in various animals, etc.), then what *else* are they capable of denying without cause?\n\nThe willingness to stubbornly deny evolution on the basis of fallacious arguments denotes an inherent problem with their decision making. Imagine how much *better* that brilliant surgeon, chemist, what have you, might be if their thought processes were corrected to eliminate this flaw.\n\nEDIT: I accidentally a word.	1336759634

Gotcha.  Yeah, GBS can sometimes result from auto-immune responses to a vaccine.  I always find it curious that it so often gets brought up in the context of vaccination but almost never elsewhere.  GBS is a haywire response of the immune system and it also occurs when people actually get sick, including when people get the flu!\n\nI suppose it is more dramatic when a healthy person gets GBS after a vaccination.  But it's also valid to point out that flu sufferers can see GBS after being sick.	1256945186

&gt;into nothing more than a small version of /r/atheism where all we do is tell each other how smart we are and how stupid everyone else is.\n\nYou're missing so much of the point.

Their reaction was the strangest part of this. I think I recognized those boys (they were maybe around 18 - 20) as friends of a family who lived nearby. They would always ask me for cigarettes if they are the guys I think they were. Although that family still lives nearby, I haven't seen those guys since that night. \n\nTheir reaction really was very bizarre. While the part of my mind that loves mystery and conspiracy, regarding both as exciting and fun, I rather think that their reaction might be somewhat typical: the reaction of people who don't want to believe their eyes. I'm sure you've seen that mentality with some people in the past - where looking away and going about your business is easier than accepting that there is no "non-fantastic" explanation for something that's right in front of you. \n\nTo answer the question if I noticed something else, no. I kept and eye on my watch from the moment I first spotted it and noticed no "missing time", saw nothing prowling around in the area or anything else unusual aside from the thing hanging in the sky above me. \n\nSomething I haven't mentioned, though, those guys who turned and walked away silently, they walked along the side walk that wrapped around the building and did not return. I remembered them always parking in the ample spots in front of the building in the past. \n\n	1318456380

Futurism is, at least for me, a fun bit of show. At the heart of it is pure speculation, taking current trends and extrapolating out from there. Just as an economist cannot possibly predict two months into the future, so the same is with future technology. \n\nI worked at a video game company ten years ago and we predicted that cell phones would be the big market for games a decade later (we nailed that) but we had no idea technologies like Twitter and Facebook would be the titans they are on mobile. Disruptive technologies will always arise and throw off the linear curve that a technology was going on.\n\nAnyone that believes strongly in the singularity needs to critically evaluate how slow our medical progress really has been. We are not just our brains, our whole body make up the what we are. What we consider reality is just what our brains composite in aggregate from our senses. It isn't enough to simulate a brain, we'd need to simulate everything from sense organs to circulatory systems. People with artificial hearts have reported trouble sleeping because they lack a pulse. (Citation needed of course, my father and grandfather are docs and mentioned this last year at christmas dinner)\n\nI think your skepticism is well warranted, but don't miss the chance to experience the world the way it can be. I think starting a sentence with "What if . . . " usually ends with a fantastic conversation.	1352731432
From the sources on wikipedia's Teflon article, I found [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18419647), which seems to indicate that teflon and related cookware account for a very minor amount of the PFCs a person absorbs. I'm not sure if that's just likely to make your mother worried about the food and water that the article says account for the majority though.\n\nTo further that point, the natural news article itself notes that the study took place in the Faroe islands because uptake of PFCs is associated with eating fish, and nothing quoted in the article by any scientists mentions absorbing PFCs from household appliances.\n\n	1328302121

&gt; Is there not? The supporters of organic foods that I talk to seem to do this and watch the grainy youtube videos that support all sorts of inaccuracies.\n\nI don't think there is. I am not even sure which grainy videos do you refer to. I would prefer you referred to facts, such as the regulations. For example, do you not think that you would prefer to drink the milk produced according to the rules that I have cited, or do you really insist on your cow being fed plastic and manure?\n\n&gt; Obviously this is only my experience but from what I've seen Brian has been great at preventing more misinformation from being spread. \n\nNot about organic food. He has picked a few and well between facts, and he has painted a picture based on these facts. Yes, organic food does indeed use fertilizers. But also, while they are fertilizers, it uses fewer kinds, which is good for people who want to avoid certain pesticides (and other chemicals) more than others for social reasons. For example, I may want to avoid roundup not because I think it is somehow more poisonous than other pesticides (I am not sure which pesticide is the "worst"), but I may have a gripe with Monsanto for its corporate tactics. As a customer, I am happy to have that choice.\n\n&gt; He usually goes over a number of claims (for everything from Bigfoot to organic food myths) and discusses why they are factual or not.\n\nWith organic food he has chosen to paint the picture that suited his opinion. He has chosen a few and far in-between facts and he has mischaracterized the organic food idea entirely. He stuck to the fact that fertilizers and pesticides are allowed in organic food and blown it out of proportion. I do agree that many people want to have food without chemicals, and, currently, there is no official standard in US to label such food. There could be, but there isn't one. Still, to many organic food consumers it does matter that the list of allowed chemicals is limited. It matters even more that organic food is about much more than just use of chemicals. It is not perfect, but certainly most of us would read many organic food regulations and wonder how on earth are such things allowed at all. Feeding cows plastic and manure is just but one example. There are some things like point (8) that we all know most animals in industrial farming will never get. Also, check my link to Google Scholar for scientific evidence that organic milk has clear advantages over non-organic milk. So there is science.	1352468995

That was the one. While I would not say natural medicine and other practices have no value I am skeptical in the sense that many people have given it a bad name in while trying to make a buck. Also I am skeptical that natural medicine is effective because it is largely ignored by the scientific community and hence not enough empirical evidence to effectively evaluate those treatments. A catch 22 if you will. This is complicated by the fact that large scale trials are hugely expensive and probably not a big enough profit margin for companies to purse serious research in the area. \n\n"Even if purely psychological, if it's proven to do some good, any at all, it should not simply be thrown to the curb by the skeptics like so much I see here in r/skeptic."\n\nWhile I agree with you that if it does some good it should not be discarded out right if I broke my arm and the pill on the left will relieve 35% of my pain (statistically significant and homeopathic) or the pill on the left will relieve 100% percent of my pain (pharmaceutical) I can guarantee you which one I will take every time.

Homeopathy is bullshit. Magnet therapy is bullshit.

I don't think I have ever, in my life, met an MD who had the ability to listen and communicate well with me as a patient. It almost seems that they train MD's not to listen in school.\nOf the doctors of Chinese Medicine I have gone to, I have been lucky enough to find a real healer 2x.

I've said it before and I'll say it again:\n\nThe *only* good documentary about UFOs that I have seen is the 1956 docu-drama **[UFOs: The True Story of the Flying Saucers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bGTLtdwPHM)**. \n\nWhen I say "good", I mean, "it has an impeccable and honest commitment to 'the truth'; it has a near-zero percent chance of being fake/hoaxed/disinfo; and by watching it, you learn *more* facts about UFOs, not *less*." I can't stress how important the last point is, and how easy it is to miss when a documentary has limited your perspective and attentions rather than expanding them. \n\nGetting back to my recommendation, [The Montana](http://www.nicap.org/mariana.htm) and the [Utah Films](http://www.nicap.org/utah2.htm) remain two of the best documented, best analyzed publicly known Unknowns -- and yes, you can see them online but I suggest watching the entire **UFOs** movie for invaluable context. Both were specifically declassified for public consumption for this film. And indeed, this fact has fueled some speculation that the whole production was an attempt to test the waters for a full-blown public disclosure, whatever that would have meant in the mid-50s. \n\nThe film is downright boring in its commitment to fidelity to facts over dramatic action. And considering that both Edward Ruppelt and Dewey Fournet worked extensively on the film to help ensure accuracy, it has *by far* the highest intellectual standards of anything you can watch about UFOs this side of **2001: A Space Odyssey** and **Close Encounters of the Third Kind**. Finally, the US natinal security state -- to take Richard Dolan's excellent phrase -- evolved a lot between 1956 and 1966, let alone the present day. UFOs is a document from a time when the government was less sophisticated in its use of PR, and the Great Taboo that the CIA's Robertson Panel dreamt up in 1953 hadn't truly had time to ferment yet in the American subconscious.\n\nI challenege anyone to take the assertions made by this film and attempt to verify/disprove them (your choice of course). You will find that almost every detail, assertion and narrative scene stands up to scrutiny and skepticism of the highest intellectual degree. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**[UFOs: The True Story of the Flying Saucers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bGTLtdwPHM)** rewards serious scrutiny while most other UFO documentaries don't (if your standards rise above the **Zeitgeist**/**Loose Change** level).\n\n**EDIT**\n\nHaving checked out Drmorose's [suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/j4jk6/ufoaliens_documentaries_is_there_is_anything_else/c295k5j), I have to say that [UFOs It Has Begun (1976, 1979)](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7100303682843029418) is a second "good UFO documentary" by my own standards. But I should have expected no less from a documentary so strongly influenced by Jaques Vallée. 	1312151606

&gt;Things like souls, the afterlife, a supernatural creator, the resurrection, prayer, original sin, immaculate conception, transubstantiation, etc, aren't testable at all, and those are the things that form the basis for most major religions. \n\nTransubstantiation seems pretty borderline to me, Catholics just assert that it can't be tested even though the claims certainly seem testable. Though some of them might claim that it changes only in the spiritual dimension or something.\n\nMany of those other things can I think be render superfluous, and I think that most religious people are intelligent enough to know that, if something is superfluous when it comes to explaining the natural world (sorry this sentence is fully inadequate but I think you get my meaning), then it's not worth believing.\n\nEven believers in ancient aliens building the pyramids I think would abandon belief if they thought the aliens were superfluous. That's why they direct so much energy at trying to discredit any explanations of how humans could have built the pyramids on their own. Equivalently many religious people try to discredit ideas that would render their beliefs (creationism) superfluous.\n\nTo think that religious people would continue to believe while accepting that their religious beliefs were completely superfluous to explaining the natural world, would I think be hugely insulting. I do not believe that the vast majority of religious people could be that different from us.	1348137660

I don't really disagree; however this subreddit has a bad habit of mixing the jam with the cheese, so to speak.  For example, the articles quoted in another thread as being "devastating" to the claims against chiropractic were *specifically* all studies that measured the efficacy of spinal manipulation in treating things like colic in children.\n\nWhich is good for what it is -- except that the OP asked specifically about the efficacy of chiropractic in treating neck and back pain in adults.  The fact that some chiropractic claims are stupidly inflated does not mean other claims are automatically invalid. \n\nAgain, not really arguing the point.  My own experience is purely anecdotal.  I just wish that here, more than anywhere, logic would be paramount.	1306560107
Yeah I came across that passage as well. I see your point. However, we have to consider that ancient cultures were elongating their skulls so their children would bear closer resemblance to the gods. The only thing, is that these look strikingly similar to the "starchild" skulls of pre-columbian Mayan civilization, and less like the ones proven to have been elongated by humans themselves.

As you should. I like visiting this subreddit to read spooky stories, and some of them are quite well done. The ones that are entertaining to read, I can just ignore thinking about how improbable they are in reality and enjoy them as fiction.\n\nHowever, the crazy &amp; paranoid posts that crop up so often are just a chore to downvote &amp; hide. You can talk to dead people, you say? Could you please prove it, and give immeasurable comfort to millions of people, grieving over loved ones? Or just to help answer one of humanity's oldest questions regarding death? Oh... No, you're not willing to provide any evidence... You just want to spout nonsense for attention.\n\n...and so on.	1335495702

You clearly don't have a ffing clue about what it takes, so whatever.\n\nI'm the guy who thinks basic objectivity and factual information will eventually show disbelievers that UFOs are real. \n\nI'm also the guy who thinks that people (like you) who pull their feel-goody fantasies right out of their asses and present them as valid information with zero basis in reality are the primary reason that UFOs and those who believe they exist are considered to be idiots and kooks. \n\nAll you are doing is setting the entire field back with every bullshit 'theory' that you 'intuit', and you steal away credibility from the people doing the REAL work, like Rich Dolan, Liz Kean, Stan Friedman, etcetera.

Yes you've made it clear that you're not a Creationist, and I never implied you were. You were corrected on your use of "theory." Get over it. \n\nYour rationalization of why he is a Creationist is pointless. Creationism is not a competing theory to evolution. Someone could find evidence that contradicts evolution and form a new theory based on the evidence. This is how Science works. You don't have to automatically be a Creationist. This is what I was talking about. That all these theologians and "scientists" that attempt to disprove evolution through Young Earth Creationism are not doing Science, and I would actually be interested in someone challenging evolution through actual Science and not magic.	1335546529

Wikipedia has some details about it:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transexualism\n\nSome schools of thought feel that it has to do with hormone imbalance.  Some feel it is a variation of hermaphroditism.  \n\nI am curious as to why you are putting forth this question, though.  My thoughts on the matter are:  does it really matter?  As far as I am concerned, every individual's mind is their sovereign property, to do with as they please.  The body, being the housing of the mind/brain, is merely a vessel.  If I wish to transform the vessel housing my mind in a way of my choosing, then why shouldn't I?  \n\nChange my gender?  Ok, sure.  Lop off an arm?  Why not?  If I make someone else uncomfortable to look at me, is that any legitimate reason for me to limit my own personal expression?  Neck tattoos look completely stupid (IMO, clearly), but I see no reason to legislate against them.  Once we achieve the technology, should people wish to do so, I see no reason not to add a third arm, or 10 fingers on each hand.  \n\nIf I feel as though I wish to alter my appearance in any way, that should ultimately be up to me, no matter the reason, and not be limited by whether or not someone else feels uncomfortable by it.	1323366586

That is a wonderful strawman you have there.  I am merley pointing out the problem of incommensurability and relating it to creationist psuedoscience.

I did not ask. Perhaps strange, but true. I guess I was coping with it in my own way, and that was just to continue on and let it roll.\n\nAs far as the strangeness of Golden Bay. Let me mark some key experiences.\n\n- when I arrived into Golden Bay, biking over a mountain range to do so, I rolled into town and asked this man outside of the grocery store where I could free camp. He directed me to a bridge just down the road. I went there and beneath it there were around 25 other travelers. From all over the world. We all played music together and then played a soccer match in a cow field. It doesn't sound that strange, but it was, it was beautifully strange.\n\n- when I arrived at the Buddhist sanctuary/camp ground I stayed for a couple of days and it was a magical place. However on my leave I was standing by a tea house overlooking the ocean, saying good bye to one of the travelers, an English guy. Right then a large cicada landed on my chest. It was oddly timed and awkward. My friend pulled it off me as I was having difficulty. Later a different friend told me that Cicadas have special relevance in Buddhism. \n\n- I met a woman there from Spain who was very quiet, we talked a little and she drove me and some others around. So I leave Golden Bay after about a week and I meet this same woman again about 1000 miles later in a small mountain village. She told me she was running from her past. She exclaimed that who she once was was very manipulative and she was literally living on the run from what she claimed was a dark personality. We talked into the night. She had suffered a really bad drug trip, but this also enlightened her to some extent to her former controlling nature, and so there she was.\n\nThese may not sound strange to some but my whole experience in Golden Bay was different. Besides sleeping in fields of sheep and sandflies and being surrounded by beauty. It's as if when I crossed over the mountains I was in a place that was governed a little differently. This is probably mostly cultural. But otherwise, these events left a deep mark on me. 	1354393910

What is this article saying?\n\n1) In the face of ever more faceless enemies (let's look at that "enemies" claim in a minute), the world needs sharp, savvy critics who are unafraid to stand up and loudly challenge systems which exploit and victimize innocent people.\n\n2) People who follow James Randi select easy targets to debunk.\n\n3) James Randi is unqualified to have opinions on current events because he is not sufficiently educated. (Again, let's look at this in a minute.)\n\n4) James Randi's creation of the JREF was merely a maneuver to increase his notoriety and attract followers.\n\n5) Penn and Teller, two additional stage magicians, are setting themselves up to inherit the torch of theatrical skepticism from James Randi.\n\n6) **Skeptics are every bit as susceptible to the desire to form tribes as any other human being. The real issue is not that skeptics are deliberately evil, or that they don't challenge themselves against real targets, but that skepticism is becoming a venue for people to feel superior in a crowd of like-minded naysayers.**\n\n7) **Skeptics are addicted to the thrill of taking down their opponents, and must continually seek out new enemies to vanquish.**\n\n8) True telepathy has been discovered, and brain implants/other technologies amplifying telepathic abilities will be widely accepted in the consumer market by 2020.\n\n9) Skeptics refuse to believe that the military, the government, and other powerful figures and organizations have been performing unethical mind control experiments on innocent people for years. **The victims of mind control experiments who come under fire from skeptics for claiming that their experiences were true are hurt even further by their treatment at the hands of skeptics.**\n\n10) **Skepticism is no longer a tool being used to take down charlatans, but has become a movement enforcing conformity and strict unity of thought.**\n\n\n	1289917313

yeah, it's people. Persons is like when you're picking out certain people. People comes from populous, and refers to a whole collective entity. The difference is that when you use Persons, the individual is important, when you use People, the group *en masse* is what's important. \n\nIn the same way Peoples refer to more than one collective entity. If he were explaining it to many different peoples it would be like explaining it to the English, americans, jews, arabs, chinese etc. 	1319932728
This might actually be a good topic for r/philosophy, for me it boils down to the Drake equation and similar estimates of probability of intelligent life, but whether that's sufficient proof depends on what you believe to be the nature of the universe - and that's something modern science simply can't conclusively answer.\n\nIf you believe in an infinite universe, then there is almost certainly intelligent alien life and the remaining question is whether any of them have come here (and that's something I'm absolutely not prepared to get into here).\n\nIf you believe in a finite universe, then as a skeptic you ought to want more proof than a probability equation, and I haven't looked into the question nearly enough to render any sort of opinion one way or the other on whether such proof exists or is credible.\n\nFinite universe? cognitive dissonance.  \nInfinite universe? cognitive harmony.	1328331928

&gt;But why should the rest of us believe them any more than crazy Aunt Hattie, who swears that she had a sexual encounter with fairies?\n\nReally there is no black and white, everything is a shade of gray (no pun intended) when it comes to figuring out fact. If lots of people with abductions experiences have non-terrestrial objects in them (without any incision scars), I'd say it paints the ET hypothesis in a lighter shade.  \n\nI don't mean to sound insulting (I know I'll sound that way anyhow) but I don't think guys like you will ever budge until *The Powers That Be* give you permission to change the way you think. You don't really want physical evidence (even though you initially asked Oryx for some); you want Katie Couric, the Deans at MIT, and the White House to tell you that ET visitation is now sanctioned as a serious subject.\n\nAnyway, if ETs ever become widely accepted to be real it won't be because of reason, science, and data; it will be because people with high social status said it's OK to think that now.	1264497519

yes. My grandfather *(moms dad) was the first. He passed alone when he had a heart attack at his home. My grandmother (who is still living) was at work and when she came home she found him. It was so sad. I still miss him.\n\nMy grandmother (dads mom) recently passed in November in a tragic accident. She was knocked over by a person in a bar (she was a wild and exciting woman for her age) and hit her head. She became unconscious and slipped into a coma. She passed after being taken off life support. \n\nI have yet to see my grandmother, however I dream of her often. But I saw my grandfather a few weeks after he passed. He was in the kitchen with my grandmother. Standing behind her, propped up on the counter. Just watching her while she cooked. he tried to brush the hair from her eyes, and just smiled at her so lovingly. he looked at me and "shhhh'd" me, and winked. Like it was our secret. He then leaned over to kiss her cheek and dissapeared into the back room. My grandmother swears sometimes that she can hear him laugh or sometimes snore when shes alone. :) I never told her about him visiting but I think she knows. Once I caught her talking to him. she was just talking out loud and said "Now James (my grandfathers name) if you keep waking me up at night I swear I will burn one of your favorite records!" lol she always threatened him like that when he was alive. I think it was an inside joke between them b.c they would always laugh after she said it.\n	1333767599

I've taken Paxil myself for 3-6 months at a time after my mom passed away from cancer. I have to say, it's one of the weirder drugs I've taken. Takes a week or two for your body to adjust to it, and then you're pretty much hooked on it because of the very unpleasant withdrawal effects, regardless of whether it's doing anything for your depression.\n\nAfter about 6 months on it, I realized it really didn't make a huge difference - the only thing that really helped was getting my life in order (exercising, not letting the house go to shit by not doing dishes/cleaning/etc.) and deciding to do things that the voice in the back of my head said I'd hate doing because I felt sad and wanted to crawl into a hole. I suppose depression is a personal journey that's different for everyone, but I stand squarely on the side of Paxil being an ineffective drug that has mild, if any benefits and plenty of drawbacks that would lead me to say it really shouldn't be prescribed. \n\nGiven the enormous amount of studies on SSRI's that show only a slightly better effect than placebo, seems that my anecdotal experience is backed up by the science.	1334326888

I'm not a believer in all things alien, but hypothetically speaking, the government has unlimited resources. Really. Unlimited. With all the reports of billions of dollars here and there just being "missing" with no trail or indication of where it could be, there could very well be trillions of dollars in hiding. Being spent on god knows what.\n\nImagine recruiting the smartest people on earth for a project that could last forever. A project that you have trillions of dollars to experiment with. How much did it cost to develop the first iPhone that blew people away? Now think a trillion dollars. We're talking real world sci fi type stuff that if people saw it, would not believe how far we've come. Perfect invisibility, teleportation, mind reading, quantum computers/dna based computing, robots that think like real people, faster than light vehicles. If i was a conspiracy theorist, i'd say the US shut down manned spaceflight programs because it was just a public face. Because our government already has the technology that would easily dwarf what nasa's doing right now, but is keeping it secret. We could very well have technology that allows us to travel to the moon in minutes. Imagine having that and spending billions on a space program. Waste of money right? Pointless right?

I like the approach, but this article needs some work.  \n\n\nA better way to address #2: if we could see the future, optical illusions wouldn't work [reference](http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080602-foresee-future.html)\n\nOn the other hand, \n\n&gt;"Psychic abilities ... would be widespread throughout the animal kingdom, just as eyes and ears are." \n\nWatching pack animals cooperate, I'd almost believe in psychic communication.  It makes more sense than "They're magically born knowing what to do".\n\n\nNow that I'm thinking about it, what's really psychic, anyway?  I mean, you're reading my thoughts right now across thousands of miles.	1275140316
Quite a bit of this is misleading, even if true. More green space doesn't reduce crime, more green space is a sign of wealth in a city, or else low population density, either of those would explain a decrease in crime.\n\nThe green space doesn't cause less crime, the lower crime rate and the green space likely have a common cause.	1341015579

What is means is not that liberals are correct, but that reality doesn't reflect republican ideas, because the current age of republicans are living in a bubble far far away from reality. Both economically "trickle down economics" and pretty anything that has to do with their social conservatism / christian right authoritarian stances. When you watch Fox News, they don't rely on facts or evidence at all for their arguments, they lie all the time, because they don't care about truth, they care about furthering their narrative.\n\nThis is why reality has a "non extreme christian right, free market corporatist" bias.\n	1330472578

Again, over simplification and jumping to conclusion. You seem to know the foundations here, so you would know that its more complicated than that. They couldve done a Cost Utility Analysis to show that there are more quality life years gained with a chiro versus other options, etc Also their research mustve shown that people placed high priority of chiro's. Back and neck pain from having a car totalled is not something that can be fooled easily with a placebo effect from the mind. Im sure you are aware that is some of the worst pain imaginable and also that hardest to manage. Thats why all your chronic opiod users are people with long term back pain, because nothing else works but strong narcotics and heavy anti inflammatories. \n\nSo point is, with such a severe injury, why would people keep turning to chiropractors if they didnt work? Its not like other so called "quaks" that you wouldnt know the difference if you had or had not gone there, and so the "doc" takes the side of "you didnt get a cold this season, therefore the herbal mixture you've been taking worked as expected"....We are talking about extreme pain that either have, have less of, of no longer have. When dealing with extreme pain, its an easily distinguishable difference, and if nothing but heavy narcs can control the pain, i believe placebo effect wouldnt help it either.	1331593192
If you listen to coast to coast for the credibility you're going to have a bad time. Coast to Coast is like a canvas, they throw anything and everything at it, some stuff is more credible than other stuff.

Well, it's economics and logistics, but it's also public perception, fear and misunderstanding of science, so I'd say science is a part of it. When the folks at the UN don't understand the science, they're risking making a disastrous decision based on ignorance and fear.	1355794718

&gt;the US second amendment is mind-boggling to me\n\nI knew this was going to be mentioned. I could explain it to you in a rational way, but you need to first promise me that you haven't already made up your mind and are open to the possibility that the second amendment is a very important part of our constitution. The gun debate is extremely politically and emotionally charged and I won't discuss it with anyone who will blindly subscribe to 100% of the political ideologies of their "party" or who will listen to emotional arguments rather than rational ones.\n\nPenn and Teller's explanation of the Second Amendment touches on this but also misses a few of the important points, IIRC.	1325085877
Yep. I've got a motor vehicle-related neck injury I've treated for a decade or so with Chiro. Not exclusively, just as part of the overall approach, chiro is good for when the pain is acute.

You will make it to some sort of success, but I don't know if it's med school or not. Your success is rooted in helping others, but I also find that as you heal others, you destroy yourself. You need to be wary of this, and balance the pursuit of flesh pleasure with spiritual pleasure. Likewise, you need to heal yourself before you can heal others, and your cards suggest you are carrying some sort of secret baggage from your past that you need to unload. Do that, and you'll be a goddamn juggernaut.	1353400156

That seems like a good idea. Keep it as simple as possible. As for the usability, here's some ideas I can think of:\n\nIt is quite confusing to display *"If you know of any, please use the links below"*, followed by three lines of *links* that are not the ones the user is looking for. The link (singular!) the user is looking for is in another paragraph and is not a link, but a button ("Rebuttal"). I think it would be much more intuitive to see something like this:\n\n&gt;**No rebuttals yet**\n&gt;\n&gt;(button) Submit a rebuttal  \n&gt;(button) Request a rebuttal  \n&gt;(button) This page rebuts another  \n&gt;\n&gt;*Help | Random discussion | Contact us*\n\nAs for the interface for pages *with* rebuttals, I think the most important thing is to get rid of as much clutter as possible, and to create an hierarchy from design. Here's a [mock-up](http://i.imgur.com/HhF6e.png) I quickly made. I would imagine up and down vote buttons on the right hand side of the little score numbers.\n\nAlso, when clicking random, I landed on the tutorial "Faux News" page in a particular instance. This should of course be eliminated from the random sequence.\n\nIf you have any questions, I am glad to help.\n\nGood luck!	1338281351

From the documentaries that I've seen, the Phoenix Lights was a massive media event and it had people and the media captivated for days (at least in the Phoenix area). The fact that multiple people witnessed seeing such a huge craft in the sky along with the grainy videos that we have on the event make it one of the most scrutinized events in UFO history.\n\nI think most of the other reports that you see on local news channels do not reach national attention mostly due to the fact that the footage is mostly inconclusive. Considering the amount of fake videos, misidentification of flares, regular military aircraft etc, it is not surprising that most videos or pictures are not looked at it more detail. Why would someone waste time or money investigating a video of a series of distant blinking lights taken on a cellphone camera? \n\nLook at the amount of buzz that the 'paperclip' UFO generated about a week or two ago. It started off as a local news broadcast and eventually reached the attention of the national media. I read about the event when someone posted a link to a report in this community. About two days later, I saw it on the front page of CNN. \n\nI don't agree with the fact that the media does not cover UFO reports. In fact, I think they do pay a fair amount of attention to it. One could argue that they do adopt a condescending tone sometimes, but they are fairly active in covering UFO reports.\n\nI think what we need is a massive sighting bang in the middle of a major city on a clear sunny day with the object in sight for more than 10-15 minutes. I think all hell will break loose then. I bet the media would love to have such an event happen and it'd whip up a massive frenzy. 	1352439663
Thank God! :D	1303700732
I agree. If anyone ever compiled a video of all these similar craft sightings, I think it would be pretty interesting. \n\nAgain, its the multiplicity that has caught my attention. 1-off UFOs dont impress me, but when its the same shape/colors/behavior over and over again...\n\nI'm on your side, i just can't say for sure. :)	1287782961

Hi let me explain a little about the pro pit movement. This very small group of people are very well organized and funded well by the industries, groups and charities that make huge amounts of money off these dogs. \n\nThus they cannot afford to admit the obvious truths. They have a set of at least 25 myths, misinformation and lies they use to try hide the truth and deny the problems that exist today.\n\nMyths such as the Nanny dog myth, the ATTS myth, the its always the owner myth and on and on. Each of these myths has been disproved and yet they continue to try to convince people they are true.\n\nHowever there are many facts backed up by empirical evidence that show the seriousness of this growing crisis. Here are some\n\nFact:  pit bulls kill more people than all other types of dogs combined.\nFact:  pit bulls dismember a body part on average every 5.5 days or less in the US alone.\nFact:  pit bulls kill a person on average every 16 days or less in the US alone\nFact:  pit bulls escape confinement 14 times more often than other type dogs.\nFact:  pit bulls turn on and attack their owners 6 times more than other type dogs.\nFact:  pit bulls are the only dog known to attack adults as often as children.\nFact: In every study done by cities t on the numbers of bites and attacks in their towns. pit bulls have been shown to bite more, attack more and cause much more damage than other dogs.\n\nPit bulls are inherently dangerous for many reasons and the pit bull advocacy is continuing to knowingly make the problems worse just to protect their income streams.\n\nPit bull advocates have been exposed for their efforts to try to skew polls by flooding them with their calls to actions, by calling for harassment campaigns against media outlets and government officials to try to silence those who speak the truth and prevent any laws being passed to protect the public from the dogs and their just as dangerous owners.\n\nThey have even gone as far as to put out a call to action in Ontario telling their members to call and email their representatives every day and make them fear pit bull owners and advocates.\n\nMost of the pit owners may not even be aware of the truth in all matters but they are in some and they still choose to be deliberately deceitful and knowingly dishonest in spreading myths, misinformation and lies that put people in harms way, get people hurt and killed, and help to make the problem grow worse year after year.\n\nThe pit bull advocates in many cases have ben caught making comment such as the following:\n\n"I have pit bulls because puppies ruin carpets but kids ruin lives" This from meagan krumpholz on facebook and her pinterest page.\n"The kids deserved to get mauled" On kgun 9 on your sides page.\n"I hope the dog dies" This by the owner of a pit who had just pulled the owner by the leash into someone else's yard and attacked their small dog.\n"the dog is the victim" This we hear often after a fatal mauling. No compassion for the innocent victims and no concern for the human life lost.\n\nFinally go to almost any story of an attack by a pit bull and watch the pit bull owners and advocates start coming up with complete nonsense in an effort to blame anyone, anything and everyone except the dog that did the attack. They heap insult and harassment upon the victims and their families, they heap abuse and hate upon them and even the dogs owner all in an effort to try to protect a dog that has just seriously mauled or killed a person or someones beloved pet.\n\nYes be very skeptical of the pro pit bull movement as most if all care nothing for the truth or honesty just protecting the pit bull no matter what in any way they can try.	1337628109

OK, But birds is still an unlikely explanation.  Did a quick search and found some info on birds...\n\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/How_Fast.html\n\nIt states that in some cases birds can reach a speed of 60+ MPH and that the highest alt. they would ever reach would be 20k feet.  Lets say that commercial jet shown is flying at 20K and we know that its moving way faster than 60mph.  Yet the objects in question are moving much faster than the jet.  \n\nBirds flying at 60mph/20k feet would be moving across the sky at a much, much slower rate.  Please point out where I am confused.	1310683224
... What's wrong with homeopathy..? I've actually used this exact stuff on my cats. Homeopathic worm treatments and fleas treatments. Both worked. I like non-homeopathic stuff too, but sometimes I feel safer using a natural product. So you want to strangle me now? Grow up.	1311055410
That they all seem to 'land' at the same spot leads me to speculate that this video is in reverse, and that the 'landing' spot is actually where these things are lifting off.  Flares would tend to fall straight down, and even if they didn't, I can't see how they would originate from a constantly shifting aerial platform and then all fall to earth in the exact same place.  That the sound is proper forward motion leads me to think this is a mildly more intelligent than usual hoax (though not by much), but a hoax nonetheless. Combine that bit of knowledge with what we already know about how flickering is indicative of chinese lanterns or other candle-powered lighter than air balloon systems, and this could be more accurately labeled "WORST UFO HOAX on video November 30,2012."  Also, it's either in black and white due to some sort of night vision mode, which is unlikely because we're not seeing any more detail than would normally be caught at night, or it's in black and white to disguise what would otherwise be obvious orange candle fire.	1354405430
&gt;Again, are you going to claim that knowledge gathered through the scientific process is just opinion? \n\nI can't even see how you can come back to this idea having gotten this far. Your just throwing out strawmen.\n\nHow difficult is it to understand that our current knowledge has limitations and emerging science can be easily riddled with issues. Can you not find a middle ground between accepting the existence of limitations and "opinion"?\n\nAnd yes, if you don't know what the hell you're talking about you shouldn't be picking sides. Is this a controversial idea? You propose a situation where a layman has to choose between two conflicting experts. How the hell are they supposed to choose? Why *shouldn't* they be suspending judgement? What is the virtue in picking one for the sake of taking a stance if they can't decide for themselves?\n\nThe thought process you have behind this is really just reinforcing the issues that I'm poking at.\n\nMy points are as follows:\n\n**Literature has limitations. Citing it ought to acknowledge as much.**\n\n**If you support scientific consensus without knowing anything about the topic, that's OK, but it isn't skepticism**\n\n**Skepticism should involve the *logical debunking* of an idea, not merely appealing to what is already said regardless of how valid it is**\n\n**If you don't know what the fuck you're talking about and there is no clear consensus, DON'T PICK SIDES**\n\nThat is consistent with everything I have said. If you want to take an issue with anything in bold I'll listen. But no more of this "science is opinion" crap.	1325829828

Also something about his work w the Warrens on the haunting in Connecticut. (Google) I watch it when nothing is on, but not like some of the other more plausible ones.

Apparently you only skimmed over that last sentence, or else you would show some knowledge of its contents beyond the words contained within it. (I won't go into your 3 hilarious misspellings, as I feel it cheapens the discussion (har-har).) Since, according to your comment, you think you have the right to command another adult how they can talk about themselves, we stand on completely different moral grounds and the "discussion" should be finished here. But I would rather convince you that my standing on this matter is very reasonable and justified, as I (naturally) believe. Also, I'm bored.\n\nI belive that nobody, neither me nor you, have the right to condemn what consenting adults privately do. Nobody is harmed by any such thing; those eager to be offended by anything they wouldn't enjoy personally don't even have to see it.\n\nSo, what *do* you see wrong with it? Perhaps you feel it is cheating in a kind of competition taking place in your head to have the most sex possible that there are people who are happy with a same-sex partner while your attempts to woo a member of the opposite sex were tragically unsuccessful in the past?	1270337331

Sorry for being unclear. By debunking I mean all of the red comments on the right. "Debunking" the "original" image in the center, which was doctored.\n\nMy assumption is that one person originally created the altered "original" image, and also created the red text, to deliberately make Fox news look bad. \n\nI could understand the satirical argument, if it were just the original image. But this kind of choice I realize is very subjective. 	1332760847

Speaking of ghosts, that's how she fell. A ghost pushed her. Haha. She's always talking about how as a kid her grandparents house was haunted and she always saw peoples ghosts face to face, and that objects would get picked up, stop in the air, and then just drop to the floor. Whats up with that? More false memories? \n \n**tl;dr Ghost confuses child with jenga tower.**  \n\n\nShe also believes that she's been talking to god since she was a very young child, and my idea is that because she has such an unshakable belief in god; naturally she'd convince herself she knew of him before ever being told. Demons, angels, ghosts, god, the devil, my schizo father, believes in all of it. Obviously a very superstitious person. Makes sense she'd make up false memories, or misinterpret them.\n\n\nWhy do some people develop these beliefs? Defense mechanism for lacking a sense of security or knowledge of the world? Parental replacement? Escape from a reality they find disappointing? Middle child syndrome, feeling alone and unappreciated, thus adopting a belief that places them in the center of the universe? What do these beliefs say about a person?\n  \n\n**tl;dr: I see crazy people. Walking around like regular people. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're crazy. They're everywhere. **\n\n	1314068706

I would never touch a ouija board. Just a friendly suggestion to save your life. Although they look harmless enough, they are dangerous spiritually. If you access the spiritual relm without understanding what you are asking for you could find yourself in a dangerous position without even knowing what is happening. \n\nOn another note Ghosts should not be attracted to you. Especially without being able to be helped. Ghosts are lost spirits generally don't want to be disturbed unless you can help them. There are people called spiritual mediums with the gift to see spirits and help in this process. 	1324022119

How can a banknote be "tax-free" or "interest-free"? \n\nInflation, taxes and interest are not an inherent property of money, but emergent properties the rules a society lives by.

The "sexy" compliment is a manifestation of misogyny in that it's a form of the first (and often only) thing most people pull out as a compliment to a female speaker ("You look great!").\n\nWell, fuck how she looked - was her talk compelling and well presented? Did she get you thinking? Because that's what she's there to do, not to titillate you, and to treat her like her personal worth hinges on her appearance is a slap in the face.\n\nEDIT: It's like the way TV interviews almost always show guys from the shoulders up and women from the breasts up - it's not intentionally meant to be sexist, I'm sure, but the fact it's so consistent really does contribute to a sexist environment; the message becomes very clear that what a woman happens to be saying takes a back seat to our ability to ogle her tits.	1338675137

Point being it's not morally justified simply because the ends justify the means but because we don't value their lives anywhere near as much as those of our own species- rooting for the home team essentially.  From an evolutionary perspective it's not unsurprising that we would.  That said we try to avoid doing so because it's still somewhat morally repugnant to us to use them in experiments.  Obviously if we didn't feel it was necessary we wouldn't believe such experiments were morally justified anymore.	1343177377

"The claim is very important because women will make important health decisions based on the idea that mental retardation may be a side effect of this, which there's no evidence, so far, that it is."\n\nThis is absolutely true.  The Democrats may not be the saviors this country needs right now, but the Republicans' strategy of playing on people's fears via outrageous falsehoods in order to grab power is not just slimy, it's destructive.  Humans are naturally curious, rational creatures who want to learn about the truth of their environment, but fear can trump reason all too easily.  Not to beat a dead horse, but what we need are more scientists and engineers in power, and fewer lawyers.	1316892885

I've only had a chance to read through the 8 pages of the Magnet rpt and frankly I am amazed to see the words written on actual government documents (unredacted) that plainly say (essentially): "We don't know what they are, but they are real, and we've ruled out anything man-made. The fact is that we have to put aside what we want to believe and accept the data which leads us to believe this is in fact aliens visiting us. Now that we have accepted that fact, the goal going forward needs to be obtaining this technology for the obviouse benefits that it would provide." It then goes into a page on how they think the propulsion system somehow exploits gravity and explains briefly some of the ways they plan on investigating this phenomena and then ends there. \n\nI've just never seen a government document that I read from a government website say "Our conclusion is that UFO's are piloted by aliens, we don't know why they're here but they're here, let's accept it and move on" , shocking really. \n\n\nNote: The quotes are not actual quotes, they are very sloppy paraphrasings, they do specifically say it is extraterestrials and not of human origin though. \n\nI think disclosure is happening all around us, but I bet you won't hear much about this on the news tonight. 	1317328265

&gt;It means we know that we don't know the truth. Don't you care about that at all?\n\nI love how truthers always phrase it like that. What we _know_ is that there are people who have questions. What we _don't_ know is whether or not the "official story" is what really happened or not. The way you state things is that because person A still has questions, then event B _cannot_ be what everyone else thinks it is. The math just doesn't add up. In no way does some people questioning the official report mean that we _know_ that what is described in the official report didn't happen. The people doing the questioning could be just as wrong as those who wrote the initial report.	1290886068

It seems analogous to those libertarians who call all government action "socialism", or those Democrats who can invent a reason that any policy they don't like must be "racist", or those Republicans who find ways to associate all manner of evils with "liberalism".\n\nIf you're a Republican whose definition of "liberalism" is so broad that it includes Stalin and Hitler as well as Obama and Kucinich, it's probably not a very useful definition: it pretty much means "things I don't like." It surely doesn't aid you in predicting what modern "liberals" will do ... except possibly that they'll do things you don't like.\n\nAnd likewise, what exactly does calling evolution "a religion" accomplish? With this broad definition of "religion", what else will we sweep in?\n\n*Professional sports* have their temples, their sacrifices, their irrational rituals, their holy days. They even have elaborate ritual costumes: a fan dressed in team colors with his face painted is even more dramatic than a cardinal's robes.\n\n*University education* has temples both elaborate and expensive; it charges many of its acolytes a steep fee for participation (almost as expensive as Scientology, or heroin); it has its priesthood in the form of the full professorate; its rituals such as graduation ceremonies.\n\n*Literacy* itself could be regarded as a cult practice. Parents spend much effort to initiate their children into its mysteries. It has its temples in schools and libraries. It practices discrimination: Those who do not convert to this religion are scorned as stupid and incapable, and excluded from polite society. \n\nOr how about *driving cars*? Confirmation in this religion is an important rite of passage in young adulthood. There are temples in the form of dealerships. Those who do not practice the appropriate rituals of regular maintenance are regarded as irresponsible ... and those atheists who choose not to partake in this religion at all are frequently denounced as hippies or freaks of various sorts.\n\nWith a sufficiently broad notion of "religion", we can simply subsume all organized or semi-organized human behavior: government; economy; even dating. And insofar as we can call everything "religion", *doing so tells us nothing at all.*	1272518719

The explanation is easy and does not require magical thinking.\n\nThere are billions of people in the world.  At any given moment, positive things are happening to some and negative things are happening to others.  \n\nOn the same day, some other people had heart attacks and just died.  Some others had heart attacks and lived, but didn't win any money.  Still others won some money without having heart attacks.\n\n**TL;DR, this is pure coincidence.**	1353948221
Yes, I am often thinking of this. It would be neat if all the stories are true (sort of) but I think often about the CD player analogy. \n\nI think that the mental construction of authority is much more important than people think. I have many qualms with how governments abuse authority and how too many people trust it blindly, but in the same vein, a too precipitous denouement of that authority might be catastrophic. It might even be worse if "they" never land, the suspense might be too much maybe? Taunting our RADAR for years and years? Or perhaps they are trying to goad us into further development by challenging us and taunting our limits. I spend a lot of time thinking about this.\n\nI agree, if they are thousands of years ahead of us we probably cannot get much. I wish it were otherwise. Although perhaps we are not yet responsible enough. Who knows?\n\nI love thinking about these scenarios. To me they truly are on the frontiers of thought and possibility.\n\nAlso, I am sometimes confused by reddit's reply system, is our conversation being declared as dis-info by posters below? 	1328163605
That's fair! I just came into this thread expecting that people would be providing evidence in answer to OP's question, instead of saying it is "common knowledge". It might very well be the case that this effect is accepted across many fields of study, but I was hoping there would be more studies cited from the outset, instead of me having to prod people to produce them :P\n\nAs far as research to prove I'm not a fool (owch!), I would direct you to the general work on cognitive biases that began with Kahneman &amp; Tversky about 30 years ago, that led to research on how social positioning affects perception ([maybe start here?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Social_biases)). I know next to nothing about wine in particular (oh no, a fool!!) but my standpoint was more of the general skeptic seeing commonalities in the area of wine glassware and the sorts of domains I'm more familiar with (like scientific reasoning and that jazz).	1301507124

The point is he took the opportunity to insult people on national media.  He was not called in for that reason.  Also, India has had laws about insulting religion since the British were there - ostensibly to foster peace and tolerance between different religions, but instead used today to lock up dissidents.  He knew that and he took a risk.  It's ridiculous, but you don't see me going on TV in Iran and saying Allah is a pig for much the same reason.	1353868011

I love NPR but the issue I have with this idea is that NPR gets to decide what 'truth' is. I realize that at times the truth is pretty obvious and it is ridiculous to give the opposition equal time - like an example below about making sure flat earth believers get equal time. But too often the 'truth' is very dependent on the viewer. What happens when NPR decides something is the truth when it is simply an opinion? At least presenting both sides of an issue gives both the reporter and viewer an opportunity to understand not only what is right but WHY it is right and the other is wrong. 	1330461626
&gt; Who decides what is or is not logical?\n\nNonsense. What is logical is a matter of fact, and no one has to decide it.\n\nAlso, data don't matter to logic.

When the author stated repeatedly that 75% of the world's population is lactose intolerant, and provided a citation . . . well, I just had to read it for myself!\n\nHere's his statement:  \n\n&gt;6. Not everyone can stomach dairy.(v) About 75 percent of the world's population is genetically unable to properly digest milk and other dairy products -- a problem called lactose intolerance.\n\nAnd here's the citation:\n\nhttp://consensus.nih.gov/2010/images/lactose/lactose_finalstatement.pdf\n\n&gt;The prevalence of lactose intolerance is difficult to discern because studies have varied in their interpretation of what constitutes this condition. . . . The prevalence of lactose intolerance in the United States cannot be estimated based on available data. None of the potentially relevant studies identified in the systematic review used an adequate definition of lactose intolerance or evaluated a representative sample of the U.S. population. . . . Although these studies shed some light on the epidemiology of lactose intolerance (discussed below), they cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of lactose intolerance.\n\nand\n\n&gt;Despite the limitations in the available studies, there were several noteworthy observations. First, lactose intolerance determined by self-report or nonblinded lactose challenge is less frequent across all ethnic groups than is lactose malabsorption determined by breath hydrogen tests or lactase nonpersistence determined by biopsy or genetic testing. Second, lactose intolerance, lactose malabsorption, and lactase nonpersistence vary across racial and ethnic groups with the lowest reported occurrence in European Americans and higher although variable occurrence in African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans. The systematic evidence review notes that the racial and ethnic variability in lactose intolerance following nonblinded lactose challenge was not as extreme as that reported in lactose malabsorption and lactase nonpersistence. Third, lactose intolerance with nonblinded lactose challenge and lactose malabsorption was low in young children, but increased with age. In children younger than 6 years, lactose malabsorption was low in all the studies and peaked between ages 10 and 16 years. Little evidence suggests that lactose intolerance increases in older persons.\n\nNowhere in that statement from NIH is the assertion made that 75% of the world's population is lactose intolerant; in fact, it says quite the opposite, that we have no idea.\n\nBased on Hyman's blatant lies (not even a misunderstanding or misrepresentation) about the NIH statement's content, I would be disposed to disregard anything else he has to say.  Either he is a willful liar, or incapable of checking his own references.  \n\nEither way, he's not a reliable source of information.	1353347884

Obviously, conservation of energy applies here, but I think the poster is asking for a more in-depth answer.\n\nI can't explain how magnets work in plain English, because any analogy I might try to use will likely rely on electricity or magnetism, itself. Richard Feynman explains exactly why he can't explain in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMFPe-DwULM). \n\nThis explanation will necessarily be a simplification, since you can't get a good understanding of these things without looking at the math. In my understanding, though, magnets interact via photon exchange. Magnetic forces are caused by particles tossing around photons, little packets of energy. The particles don't actually *produce* any energy, they just exchange it, so if you pull energy out of the system, the system will still run out. \n\nThe physics of this are more complicated than simple attraction and repulsion, and most "perpetual" motion machines using magnets work based on how people *assume* magnets work, not on how they actually behave. \n\nFinally, the behavior shown is not perpetual motion or energy production at all. Even if the machine in the video actually works as shown, you'll notice that the hand holding the magnet is constantly moving slightly. That motion is required for magnetism to work properly: magnetic fields don't apply force to objects that are at rest relative to them. In moving the magnet, the man is supplying the system with energy, and I can guarantee that he's supplying it with a great deal more than you could possibly collect. 	1269135118

This would be great filming a UFO!! How?\n\nWell think about it, most UFOs travel within "a blink of an eye"- speed. So if we had this camera, we can better understand and possibly see the movement in which the UFO craft travels.\n\nI mean I have watch countless vids/reports/research regarding UFO craft movement. \n\nGenerally we think UFOs move from Point A to Point B in a "straight" line. BUt there have been videos showing that UFO aircraft moves in a "wiggly" pattern from Point A to Point B. \n\nThere was this video of an old woman who filmed UFOs for over 45+ years?? and just recently came out with her videos(over 80+?). She said as she played back the video of the UFOs frame per frame, they made "streaks of light" when they moved from POint A to Point B. Not sure what the VIdeo was called, but it can be found on YouTube.	1345262301
I would imagine that innocent people confess for a number of different reasons but here are a few:\n\n1. bad legal advice - don't listen to your cousin's uncle's best friend's legal opinion and overworked public defense miss things (or worse);\n\n2. guilt - not being guilty of the crime in question doesn't mean that you aren't guilty of something else or guilty of knowing details and not doing anything, etc etc. so in an effort to keep one secret, they 'confess' to a lie;\n\n3. fear - fear of everything - the cops, the courts, the people you know when you get out, your family, your job, etc etc. If you are looking at possible life with a jury and, say, only two years with a plea bargain if you confess, some people would rather do with the devil they know even though it's wrong;\n4. and this is the biggie - trust - you trust the system. If you are innocent and arrested for soemthing you didn't do (and I speak from a minor experience on this one) you just keep thinking that it will be okay because... you didn't do it! Of course they will do their investigation and surely I will eventually get let go and maybe even an apology. But then things just get worse and more surreal and then you realize that they are really going to arrest you. And then you ARE arrested and you STILL trust in the fact that you can't possibly be found guilty because you aren't! there can't be evidence because you are innocent! But when the dust settles and you are still on the hook, innocent people may do a lot of dumb things, not least of which is confess to a crime they didn't commit.	1330364846
This one is interesting, considering this specific theory about dreaming which basically says that the dreaming part of sleep occurs during the short period of time we wake up, the loud bang triggers your waking up and starts the dream which incorporates the event and make up a most probable story about the cause of the bang, then you finish waking up and the most probable story happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n	1326495307

It might be interesting to ask him to talk about his distinction between science and magic. As a scientist, he seems very anchored to the "nuts and bolts" theory of UFOs (or as he still calls them, "flying saucers").

My understanding is that Pusztai fed the rats raw potatoes, which rats don't want to eat anyway, because they're not nutritious enough to live on. He basically starved the rats for a couple of days, and the two varieties of potatoes were substantially different.\n\nHere's an [excellent breakdown](http://gmopundit2.blogspot.com/2006/02/analysis-of-pusztai-study-on-gm.html):\n\nUnfortunately, Pusztai’s analyses of the chemical composition of the transgenic lines were rather superficial. And his quick leap to the conclusion that the variation he observed was attributable to the fact that they were transgenic was simply unwarranted. This mistake has proved costly to Pusztai himself. And unfortunately, the expertise battle that sprang up around the experiments has obscured the importance of carrying out well-designed experiments to evaluate the food qualities of transgenic crop plants expressing proteins that have the potential of affecting human health. Lectins are clearly in this category.\n\nPusztai has been criticized severely for the quality of his experiments. His experiments have been attacked for their small sample sizes, the use of inappropriate statistical procedures, and the fact that a diet of raw – or even cooked – potatoes is a bad diet for rats (people too), even when supplemented with a bit of extra protein. But oddly enough, in all that has been written about these experiments, no one seems to have seen their central flaw, which was that he did not use appropriate controls. A “control” is the part of an experiment that allows the researcher to examine the consequences of just the change (in this case) or the treatment (in the case of a drug) under study. In Pusztai’s experiments, the control potatoes had a different history than the transgenic potatoes and, in particular, that history included a culture procedure that induces somaclonal variation. The likeliest source of the variation he detected – and of the differences he attributed to the fact that they contained foreign DNA – was the culture procedure itself. In order to be able to attribute the deleterious effects of the transgenic potatoes to the newly introduced gene or to some other part of the introduced DNA, he would have had to make a comparison between potatoes that had the very same history, but either had or lacked the transgenic construct. This can be done, but the study that Pusztai participated in was simply not designed for such a test.\n	1333150098

Well, for one, if you're vegetarian/vegan, that rules out gelcaps, which are often the only non-liquid source of DXM in pharmacies.\n\nThere was a general consensus among DXM-heads that Zicam Cough spray was the fastest-acting, hardest-hitting DXM product in existence.  It was popular among abusers; it's possibly why they stopped making it.  It had slightly more DXM than a whole bottle of cough syrup in about one-eighth the volume of liquid.  It tasted absolutely unholy, but there was a sick pleasure to be found in it.  (Again: if you're into that kind of thing.)  \n\nWhatever you're imagining about how disgusting chugging a bottle (or bottles) of cough syrup is, you're probably right.  It's *self-violation*.  There are many people out there who puke at least once every time they do it.  \n\nI was one of the people who never puked.  Never.

Doesn't cough syrup just taste like something that will do strange things to you if you drink enough of it?\n\nOr because it's the cheapest suitable product at the local pharmacy, and even cough syrup addicts have better things to spend their money on.\n\nHopefully I'll never go into a big off-topic monologue on cough medicine on reddit again...	1325011099
Organic food is only a label, [skeptoid](http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4019) did an episode on Organic food and nothing has really changed since it came out.  There was a [study](http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/2010/05/27/science-organic/) done on bird preference of organic vs standard seeds, the birds preferred the standard seeds.\n\nAs for recycling, the big issue is that it takes a lot of energy to recycle materials and that energy use may be more damaging to the environment than just putting the material in a landfill.  The thing about that argument however is that some parts of the world actually have renewable energy plans and will have a majority of energy coming from renewable resources in the near future.

You're being downvoted because you're reporting an entirely subjective experience and implying it had some objective meaning or relevance - the same kind of elementary error made by people who believe their *strong feeling* God exists constitute proof.\n\nThe error you're making is believing you're a reliable narrator, even to your own experiences.  [You are not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).\n\nRather, each time you recall an event you recall it imperfectly (and it's also influenced by the context in which you recall it), and each time you recall it your memory **re-**imprints it in your mind, diminishing or erasing the original[1].  Memory isn't some chiselled-in-stone record you look things up in, even though it subjectively feels like that.  Rather, it's more like a rumour, where instead of a list of facts you're forcing experiences to conform to a defined narrative, [every telling changes the story somewhat](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/06/memory_is_fiction.php) and how much it changes relates to how strongly you feel about the subject.  After a while it can diverge surprisingly far from reality.\n\nFor example, it's entirely possible (although you won't *feel* like it's true) that you had a strong feeling you'd catch a ball on one occasion and actualyl caught it on another, and your memory has mixed the two memories together to make a better, more satisfying narrative.  Alternatively, you might have wanted to catch the ball many times, but because you never did you forget about it.  Then the one time you *did* catch it is a big deal, so you remember that occasion but forget the others... and "I *really wanted* to catch the ball and I did" easily becomes "I *knew* I was going to catch it any I did" over time.\n\nAlternatively I would have thought every kid in the ballpark wanted to catch the ball, and at least some of them are going to be the kind of precocious kids to announce they *will* do it (outgoing kids are prone to assuming if they want something enough they will necessarily achieve it).  So in a group of thousands of kids at thousands of games across the country for many years of baseball games, eventually you're going to get a few kids out of that group who both believed they would catch a ball and caught a ball.  It's not significant - it's just a fluke of statistics that seems special because your brain latches onto it[2].\n\nWith the greatest respect, you're not getting downvoted because you've offended anyone's sensibilities, but because you're making a basic error we all know about and have moved past - your post is simply *wrong*, not controversial. &lt;:-)\n\n[1] This is really true, incidentally - [studies are being done](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article3850302.ece) where they take victims of PTSD, load them up with happy drugs like MDMA, then walk them back through their recollections of the traumatising event.\n\nThanks to the drug their present emotional state is relaxed, happy and accepting, so when they finish reliving the memories and re-imprint them, they lose much of the emotional trauma associated with the memory, and because the memory is re-imprinted the effects persist indefinitely, even after the drugs wear off.\n\nIt's a relatively new area of investigation, but the studies are showing good results.\n\n[2] A good example of this trend is if someone randomly shuffles a pack of cards and I pull out all four aces, most people would be amazed - that's millions to one, right?  Amazing!\n\nEqually, if I pull out - say - the ten of clubs, the four of diamonds, the jack of hearts and the seven of clubs nobody would be impressed even though I have exactly the same chances of getting that as any other combination, *including all four aces*.\n\nThe only difference is that *you think of four aces as being significant*, and other "random-looking" sequences as not.  Again, a cognitive illusion caused by your brain's penchant for pattern-matching, which has no real objective significance.	1276852635

I'm in pharmacology and did a project on the toxicity of aspartame in my 4th year.

&gt;Mostly due to the deliciousness of meat\n\nI assume you mean this somewhat facetiously.\n\n&gt; we do produce enough calories even with meat production to feed everyone.\n\nThe problem with meat production isn't a lack of calories; it's the damage done to the environment.  [Cattle produce more greenhouse gases than cars](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsID=20772&amp;CR1=warning#.UKb_usy_XUI), most of it in the form of methane, which is 23 times more effective as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.  [Livestock are a major contributor to water pollution](http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/ffarms.asp).\n\nAnd that only considers domesticated animals.  [According to a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimate, over 70% of the world’s fish species are either fully exploited or depleted](http://www.un.org/events/tenstories/06/story.asp?storyID=800).\n\n\nWhile I'm not trying to sell you on veganism, I do feel there are sound environmental facts in favor of reducing meat consumption.  [Americans eat twice as much meat as they did fifty years ago](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/06/27/155527365/visualizing-a-nation-of-meat-eaters), while our nutritional needs have remained largely the same.

Sambucal is a homeopathic remedy still undergoing clinical trials: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00375115\nFrom their own website:\n&gt;What clinical evidence is available to support Sambucol?\n\n..."Sambucus nigra or the black elderberry is a plant native to Europe, Northern Africa and parts of Asia. The flowers and berries have a long history of use in traditional European medicine as well as the berries being used to make wines and cordials. (1)\nThe black elderberry, due to the dark pigmentation of its fruit, contains high concentrations of the flavonoid group of antioxidants called anthocyanins. It is these natural antioxidants that give the elderberry its purple pigment. This means that the fruit of the black elderberry have powerful antioxidant capabilities. Studies looking at the antioxidant activity of many types of fruits, including the black elderberry have shown that the total antioxidative capacity of the elderberry was higher than that of the blackcurrant, gooseberry, cranberry, blueberry and redcurrant\nDue to the amount of stress that modern society places on our bodies, it may be beneficial to take an antioxidant supplement to help boost the Immune System, particularly at times such as when suffering from a cold or the flu virus.\n\nDietary supplements containing extracts from the black elderberry have long been used across the world for treating cold and flu symptoms, including aches and pains, coughing and nasal congestion.

I know of one such limited condition!  I think chiropractic disease theories are ridiculous, and so did my chiropractor.  I got into an accident, had a vertebral misalignment, and my insurance recommended a guy.  My preference would have been a DO.  But this guy had a shared practice with a licensed physical therapist, and took before and after xrays to prove it had moved and been put back.  It was a lot more PT than manipulation.  \n\nHe was clear: "Chiropractic manipulation can't keep anything it moved permanent, if anything even needs moved.  Without PT chiropractic is useless; everything will just drift back to where it was if you don't build the muscles to keep it in place."\n\nI was floored years later when I discovered how much bunk most chiropractors run on. 	1326768661

&gt; I would find it very odd if there wasn't a lot of life in the universe.\n\nYep.\n\n&gt; Doesn't mean however that anyone has contacted us yet. \n\nIf you undertake a critical examination and investigation of the phenomena on this planet, you will find that amongst the rubbled mountain heap of loony stories, debunked anecdotes, hyperbolic tales, and disinformation campaigns, there have been an untold number of valid, verifiable, and truly unexplained contacts that have taken place.\n\nLooked at in isolation, any one of these contacts might not mean much.  Taken en toto over the many decades and entirely disparate areas, countries, regions, and walks of life that these contacts and reports have taken place on, one gets a *very* clear understanding - just by the laws of probability and chance alone - that there has indubitably been a significant amount of *real* contact on this planet.\n\nAdditionally, there is nothing like personal experience to settle a matter one might have doubts about.  I have had occurrences in my life that are similar to what many have described in their own encounters.\n\nThis, along with quite a bit of other data I've come across (as well as the info I pointed out above), let me know that we not only have been contacted before on this planet, but that we are currently being contacted *now*, and that there are beings from other areas of the cosmos already on this planet as we speak.	1332439953

I was part of a cult called church of the first born. No, you can't google it, they don't use computers. Anyway, they believe in faith healing and babies die often. Actually, people of all sorts die often because they don't go to doctors. My uncle died of a spider bite. I had a great aunt who's intestines would fall out of her ass regularly until she died. The women don't cut their hair or wear shorts or pants, they can't wear make up. The men are straight out of the 1800's. Lots of inter-familial marriage. They sing 19th century hymns and church lasts from 8 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon sometimes (they have to be "lead by the spirit"). Creepy and illogical. I later became a moderate christian, then I just figured nobody knew what happened when we die. Now I'm an agnostic atheist. I was fortunate to be born with a questioning mind.

Unrelated to the analogy? \n\nWhether or not having an abortion is LESS of a loss than suffering through the hardship of a developmentally retarded child does not somehow negate that having the developmental retarded child and needing to abort it is sad.\n\nLikewise, the fact that you're better off fixing a leaking drain quickly as it will cost you less long term does not negate the fact that the drain being leaky in the first place puts you in a position worse off than if you HAD NOT HAD THE LEAKING DRAIN IN THE FIRST PLACE.	1328868758

Here's the thing; The evidence IS in. The European Union spent more than $425 million studying the safety of genetically modified crops over the past *25 years*. The conclusion of these studies can be summarized in one sentence: Crop modification by molecular methods is no more dangerous than crop modification by other methods. It has been studied- it's just that people don't want to believe it. Serious scientific bodies that have analyzed the issue, including the National Academy of Sciences and the British Royal Society, have come to the conclusion that GMO crops are safe. They've been in use for dozens of years and there has yet to be proven any link of health risk for GMO foods.\n\nAnd this is what get me: people want food labelled when there's NO REASON to believe that GMO crops are of any more danger than the foods you have that are non-GMO. It's a fear campaign, it's based on ignorance and ludditism. 	1336285482

I saw a UFO a few years ago around sunset in mid-summer. I was just casually looking up at the sky which I sometimes do and I saw what I had at first thought was an airplane. As soon as it caught my attention and I was looking at it more, it flashed and disappeared. At that point I knew it wasn't a plane for sure. I asked my friend who was with me at the time if he saw it, but he wasn't looking up and said he didn't. Then again, I can't say for sure if that's alien.	1305173953
I think I am of the belief that the skeptical community shouldn't try to get directly involved into politics for the most part because political arguments are often based on a certain worldview whose truth cannot be objectively verified.

I think the best reason to be skeptical on this beside the fact that teeth observably can't repair themselves (elderly people who still have their teeth but have been worn down over the decades are a good example) is that she didn't provide a before and after picture.

Guys, I'm opening up a new restaurant. I recently realised that all my life I've been eating all wrong. All the substance of food is what causes disease. With my new techniques, we extract the vital force of food into a water solution; the water "remembering" what food it came in contact with. By extracting this essence into the water, we can eat without having all the indigestible toxins polluting our digestive tract. Come to my restaurant and enjoy a 30C steak, some 30C potatoes, and  our trademark 50C soup. Since preparation of these foods is so labour-intensive, we have to charge more than you'd normally pay for the dishes, but your health is worth it.	1347039817

Thank you! One of the most important things people must know about "scientific theory" and "scientific law" is that they *don't imply certainty*. A "law" describes one thing, and a "theory" describes another. A "theory" can never become a "law," and a "law" can never become a "theory." A "theory" is not less certain than a "law," and a "law" is not more certain than a "theory."	1345133841

Myers quotes Kyle Hill as saying:\n\n&gt; "When I talk about skepticism, I believe that I am talking about something that encompasses many other similar philosophies like atheism, humanism, and freethought."\n\nI'm not sure such silliness is worth an impassioned blog post.  Hill is just confused.  \n\nMyers takes some time to point out Hill's first confusion, which is just the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent: even if we take it as a premise that skepticism implies atheism, this does not imply that atheism implies skepticism.\n\nBut even more confused is the idea that skepticism should encompass an ideology like humanism.  Unlike atheism, which is just a certain belief about a single topic which can be subject to skeptical inquiry, humanism, and other political ideologies like socialism, communism etc., are complex sets of beliefs that are ultimately based on subjective values.  Skepticism cannot possibly "encompass" humanism any more than it can encompass Christianity or Islam.\n	1343004853
I think I see where you're coming from, but I don't mean to say that we should just give up! I just think that you're being *too* optimistic. I mean, take your statement "everything that can't be explained will be." This statement would require (effectively, if not literally) infinite explanations of physical phenomena (and possibly, though seemingly unlikely, other currently undiscovered kinds of phenomena); we could never even come close to verifying it empirically, and so to take it as true is simply dogmatic. Even in the theoretical realm of mathematics there are things that can't be proven: the axioms, by construction, are not provable, so it will never be clear as to why we need these and not others (mathematicians please call me out if I'm wrong about this, I'm a physicist), and there are in fact certain mathematical statements which can be proven to be unprovable. In physics we're continually searching for the "theory of everything," but there are at least a fair number of us who don't think that it's even possible for us to construct one, myself included. This isn't proof by any means, but it seems compelling to me that to have a theory of everything in our system (the universe), we would need to have some kind of special vantage point outside of our system. From our current understanding of how things work it seems chimerical that this will ever happen.\n\nAnyway, my point is that we shouldn't just "give up," because if something is unknowable we don't know that it is (as far as I know there are no physical results that are proven to be unprovable) and so we'd better keep trying in case that it's not.	1340476626

First off, get the dogmatic part of understanding out of your head, or "karma" is just another bullshit religious word people use to get your money or control your behavior.  Good: now you're thinking like an atheist Buddhist.\n\nFor me, karma is much simpler than that. When I show compassion for others, they respond in kind. More important, I feel better and more worthy of happiness. If a cashier gives me change for a $20 when I gave her a $10, I will correct her, because my dignity is worth more than $10.

&gt;Sheldrake has shown in the past that **he is not afraid to be labeled a rebel**, thanks to his theory of morphic resonance, which suggests the following:\n\n&gt;    Natural systems, or morphic units, at all levels of complexity are animated, organized, and coordinated by morphic fields, which contain an inherent memory. Natural systems inherit this collective memory from all previous things of their kind by a process called morphic resonance, with the result that patterns of development and behavior become increasingly habitual through repetition.\n\nAs the good folks in CJ would say - 'So brave'.

Notice that it was published in 2009. [Here's the abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21058170) the article refers to. Read the abstract and notice that the authors used statistical regression to find the supposed link between the vaccine and autism. [Here's the article itself.](http://www.ncims.com/articles/ThirmerosalandDevelopmentalDisability.pdf) The authors tie thimerosal to "EIS," an acronym meaning "early intervention or special education services." This is not autism; the article itself says, \n\n&gt; While this study uses EIS as a proxy for developmental disability in general, but not specifically autism, autism merits consideration because it is a developmental disorder with recent notable impacts on EIS.\n\nSo the authors state that EIS is a proxy for development disability but not autism. \n\n[Here's an article](http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/09/autism-causation-and-the-hepatitis-b-vaccine-no-link/) debunking the Hep B/autism link and bemoaning the fact that the accusations never end.\n\nThe other problem, as noted in Gallagher and Goodman's article is that thimerosal is no longer used in American-made Hep B vaccines (It's still in use in a flu vaccine, I think). However, the CDC [points out](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/) that thimerosal has been used in vaccines since the 1930s, and I note that its use was without the current hysteria about autism for all those decades.\n\nThe [CDC's study](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/QA_Pediatrics-thimerosal-autism.html) was conducted with about a thousand children, about half of whom had no evidence of autism and about half were on the spectrum of some form of autism. The CDC found no connection between exposure to ethylmercury (the "bad" ingredient in thimerosal) and diagnosis of some form of autism. The study looked at vaccinations received by pregnant women as well as by newborns.\n\nThe CDC's study did not consist of running regressions on existing data to find correlations. They looked at the actual immunization histories (Gallagher and Goodman asked parents for their recollections); follow the link for the details of how the study was conducted.\n\nI mentioned that thimerosal is no longer used in Hep B vaccines. [This article from WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20080107/thimerosal-down-but-autism-rising) points out that although thimerosal is no longer in use, autism diagnoses are still rising. Normal people would expect that if thimerosal in Hep B vaccines caused autism, removing it would mean autism diagnoses would either cease or decline. Especially if, as alleged, Hep B vaccines caused a three-fold increas in autism.\n\nI call B.S.	1337982663

&gt;ometimes that standard of discussion is "males check your privilege plz," and whether or not that makes sense or is defensible I don't think it counts as discrimination.&lt;\n\nThat is exactly where you loose me. While male privilege exists (as does Female privilege, though many refuse to even discuss that idea) it is not to the extent that many people like to claim it does. Well, I think extent is the wrong word to describe that. I think that male privilege is not nearly as significant or as powerful as people want to believe it is...that is closer to what I mean. As another way of restating that, only because I feel my thoughts aren't translating well, is that male privilege in the vast majority of situations does skew the situation toward the male perspective it is likely that skewing is on the order of providing males 1-2 points of additional credence on a 10 point scale, where pretty much anyone using the term "check your privilege" likely believe it is more like a 9-10 point bump. I also believe that, while nearly 100% undiscussed, and outright denied by a large majority of feminists, female privilege is just as common and has an equal impact on societal discussions. Personally, I would go so far as to say that there is no such thing as gender privilege, but that would get me cut out of most conversations on the topic. I truly do believe that basically everything I have seen cited as a "privilege" is something that the other side would actually define as discrimination, so both parties feel wronged.  \n\nNow as to why your statement causes me a great deal of pause. I truly do consider myself egalitarian, and while I tend to take on a greater number of male rights causes (because my perspective is irrevocably skewed to the male side of things) I am a staunch defender, some may say militant, of women's rights. I love researching gender topics, and have read a significant amount of research on the subject (though today I generally dismiss anything coming out of a Women's Studies department due to essentially dismissing scientific process and displaying massive bias) and also seek out gender studies blogs and news stories. This has led to me having many conversations, both IRL and online, with both Feminists and with MRA's. Throughout years of involvement with egalitarianism and activism of this sort I have noticed a number of consistent behaviors, but no so consistent as the use of the phrase "Check your privilege" to remove a persons voice from the conversation, essentially stripping them of their own agency, and place a person squarely in an out-group identifier. Not only this, but the constant aggressive use of that phrase creates a self-affirming group-think fueled environment in which critical thought is quite literally impossible lest you be placed in the "privileged" outgroup. \n\nIn online forums "check your privilege" is most often followed by an immediate ban (or at minimum, much more scrutiny which usually leads to a ban) which means that the person who is supposedly "privileged" isn't given the choice or even the opportunity to identify where their behavior may have been inappropriate and actually learn to be more conscious of triggering statements (which only exacerbates the problem), but more sinister is that they now have yet another piece of evidence about how feminists are "man haters" or "female supremacists" who "won't even let a man speak". See, the use of the phrase actually produces a more voracious misogynist but one with greater evidence, thus increasing their ability to draw other people further away from an egalitarian mindset.   \n\nI'm not going to get into how I feel that this action, the creation of ones own enemy out of a potential ally, is definitive of the current feminist movement participants as that is a much longer conversation for a different time. I will however say that it is my honest to god conviction, and one which I have come to after significant reading and interaction as well as after being raised as a feminist and involved in feminist organizations, that modern Second Wave (and to a lesser degree Third Wave) feminism has been the single largest driving force behind the continuation and development of nearly every problem that currently faces women in today's society, not to mention the creation of a significant number of overt and covert misogynists. I know that is a HUGELY controversial statement, but one which I have not come to lightly or without evidence.  If you want to discuss this further I am happy to do so, however I do have to warn you that my school begins next week (which means I'm already 2 weeks behind in the quarter) so my time and energy will be pretty limited. Translation: it may take me quite some time to respond to anything and it may not be as coherent or as well cited as it should be. \n\nPS: I wanted to point out to you, since you used it as an example in a semi-mocking manner, that it is not fallacious to state the wage gap is a myth, it is now a well researched and evidence-based argument. An argument, I might add, that is supported by a long-term and massive study conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics overseen by a number of outspoken feminists and conceived as a study which would provide incontrovertible evidence of a major wage gap that necessitates legislative actions such as the Equal Pay amendment. It is best if you don't continue to canonize "the wage-gap" as your argument of societal sexism, as it is a major indicator that you may be the type of person who cares more about ideology than about facts. Just an FYI as many people do not know about the BLS study and because they have heard the stats so often have accepted the wage gap myth as a fact.    	1348029074

No, by question everything I mean question everything. You haven't done that if you don't think 9/11 was an inside job. You did not approach the matter objectively with the idea that it *could be an inside job* in mind. You approached it with your mind already set, solidifying your previous held judgements against the idea created by propoganda, like Bush saying "We shall not tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories about 9/11." Perhaps at one point you thought you might give the evidence a chance, but the bias still remained and you only discovered information that was most likely condescending in nature and only reaffirmed your already held belief. The truth does not persuade you, what everyone else believes and more importantly, what everyone else ridicules is what persuades you. You are not a skeptic.	1331181896

I believe all of this is true and more. If in fact they are keeping this information from us and this technology from us, they are in essence enslaving us upon this planet. They are controlling us by controlling information and technology that will give us much greater freedom from their way of life. More importantly, if this information is true and they are lying to us, everyone has a vested interest to hold them accountable for their actions. For enslaving us by keeping this from us. For this reason alone non believers should be on the front line demanding the truth and the end of the lies. If they are among us, they are part of the conspiracy and may include them controlling us for their own purposes. \n\nThis is why I believe that non believers should be the first one's to be helping us non believers get to the truth of the matter. Non believers serve as roadblocks or speed bumps to the truth. You are playing into their hands of deceit and lies. \n\nIt is very hard to realize that everything we have been told and taught is a lie. Its hard for me to believe but when you start to look at ALL of the information that is out there, how the government responds or lack of response, the warnings from people in power, the history of man wanting to control man, etc, etc, etc, you can easily start to see through the lies and deceit. \n\nThe world could be such a more better place than what we have no. We are totally under their control and most of us don't even know it. Extremely pathetic. 	1336144587

There are thousands of mysteries in science.  Some of the bigger mysteries include:\n\n* Unification of gravity with quantum physics\n* Confirmation of string theory, m-theory, and other speculative theories in physics\n* Specific mechanisms involved in the origin of life on earth\n* Specific mechanisms responsible for some of the more complex diseases and neurological disorders - Alzheimer's, autism, depression, etc.\n* Predicting events in chaotic systems - earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.\n\nThere are many large scale conspiracies that skeptics scoff at, but in a lot of cases we tend to believe in similar conspiracies just at a much smaller scale.  For example, there quacks that claim that pharmaceutical companies have a secret cure for cancer, completely own the FDA, and are poisoning your children.  I believe that pharmaceutical companies have systemic bias in their research that tacks on a few percentage points to the effectiveness of their products.  If they are hiding that bias it qualifies as a conspiracy, but ultimately it's nowhere close to the paranoid conspiracies that other people believe.  	1353902661
The scientific method requires control over variables, which has been more or less impossible in the "study" of UFOs.  They tend to appear and disappear quite unpredictably, and thus rarely leave us with anything other than ad hoc optical recordings and witness accounts.\n\nSo it's difficult to either fault people for being unscientific, or to discount the phenomenon as not being something truly novel.  We have enough data for it to be interesting, but not enough to be particularly elucidating.  So, like all phenomena that cannot be reined in with controls, it stays relegated to the "paranormal" playground.	1337195742

&gt;Perhaps it's not an official "peer review", but a scientist (I'm assuming this researcher IS a scientist) giving an opinion about another scientist's findings, even to a journalist, would count for more than if the journalist asked some joker in the DEA for his opinion, dont'cha think?\n\nNot at all, because we have no understanding of his background, potential biases on the topic, and most importantly, we only have a soundbite. We don't have his written report, and for all we know, the journalist snipped out that section to fit in with what they personally think of the study.\n\nThe fact that it passed peer review is a sign that there are no major methodological or theoretical flaws with their conclusion.\n\n&gt;point number 2 is something I replied to in your other post. what WERE the methods employed in finding their sample population? it doesn't say, which is another part of this story that smells bad to me.\n\nWhat do you mean they don't mention the methods they used? The authors have a whole section called "METHODS" where they discuss this in detail. Here's what they say:\n\n&gt;"A population-based case-control study was conducted in Los Angeles County, California to investigate associations of testis cancer risk with exposures of the perinatal period, childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Eligible cases were men diagnosed with TGCT between December 20, 1986 and April 4, 1991 in Los Angeles County; who were ages 18 to 35 years at diagnosis; spoke English; and were born either in the United States, Europe, Canada, or the Middle East. The Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program identified 201 men who met these criteria. Of these, 8 had either died before being contacted or were too ill to participate, 6 had cognitive difficulties precluding participation, 14 could not be located, 2 were not invited to participate because health care providers denied permission to contact, and 8 chose not to participate. The remaining 163 eligible cases (81%) participated in the study. For each participating case, we attempted to enroll up to 4 unaffected control men who were matched to the case on date of birth (within 3 years), race, ethnicity, and neighborhood of residence at the time of diagnosis. An established procedure was used to identify potential controls by defining a sequence of housing units on a specified block; attempting to identify the sex, age, race, and ethnicity of the inhabitants of each unit; and thereby determining whether 1 or more appropriately matched potential controls were identified. If no potential control was identified after canvassing 150 units, then race was excluded from the matching criteria; and, if a matched control based on the relaxed criteria was not identified within 150 subsequent units, then the case was not included in matched case-control analyses. The procedure described above identified 371 individuals as potential controls for the 163 eligible cases. Of these, 292 men (78.7%) chose to participate. We enrolled controls that were not matched on race/ethnicity for 24 cases, and we were unable to enroll any matched control for 24 additional cases. From 1 to 4 matched controls were enrolled for each remaining case: We identified 1 control for 16 cases, 2 controls for 95 cases, 3 controls for 26 cases, and 4 controls for 2 cases.\n\n&gt;Interviews were conducted in person at participants' homes and were administered by trained interviewers using structured questionnaires. All participants were interviewed between October 16, 1987 and December 15, 1994. Information was requested for a reference period up to 1 year before the diagnosis of TGCT for cases and the same date for each case's matched controls. Participants were asked to provide demographic information; family history of specific cancers and urogenital conditions; personal history of some infectious diseases; and personal use of tobacco, alcohol, and numerous recreational drugs. Participants were asked whether they had ever used each drug, and ever users were asked the first and last years of use and the average number of times per week of use."\n\nIt seems pretty comprehensive and detailed to me. Did you actually read the paper, or are you trying to judge the quality of the study from the newspaper article on it? If the latter, then you may want to look at the reasons why you are arguing against this finding. Are you arguing against it because it is scientifically flawed (which you can only know by reading the paper itself), or are you arguing against it because you smoke cannabis and you don't want to believe that you have increased your risk of testicular cancer?\n\n&gt;I'm not sure if you know what "disinformation" is, but it's crucial to spread it if you want to reinforce a bullshit drug war that costs taxpayers billions and erodes our Constitution like sand on a beach.\n\nThe authors don't get paid for their findings. They get paid whether there's a link or not. What you are suggesting is that people who have dedicated their lives to fighting cancer, would risk funnelling millions of dollars into a line of research which they know is fruitless, and would knowingly end up killing hundreds/thousands/millions of cancer sufferers, just to continue some vague conspiratorial notion of "spreading disinformation".\n\nThat's bullshit. At least read the fucking paper before you implicitly accuse cancer researchers of being mass murderers. 	1347418258
You know how much reddit likes TL;DR	1326842993
&gt;  to say that science will answer questions of morality and values is scientism\n\nLet me add my 2 cents on this specific issue: you and I both understand what is meant by that statement, but taken word by word, the statement can be interpreted as the assumption that there exists a "right" answer out there a priori, which science is just incapable to figure out.\n\nThat assumption in itself is a scientific issue, no? Whether the notion of objective ethical answers make any sense - it should at least be a valid scientific position to look for evidence.\n\nSo when you and I talk about it, we probably both mean that it's NOT an empirical issue (with an a priori "right" answer), but rather a decision to be taken by people, which is, of course, outside the domain of science.\n\nScience can inform us on the outcomes of decisions, but not on which decision is the "right" one to take. Not because science can't do it (and some other tool can), but because as far as we know, answers to these questions are subjective, not empirical in nature.\n\n&gt; scientific evidence is the only valid form of evidence and that all other forms are lesser, or should be rejected entirely, which is also something we should avoid. \n\nWell, this obviously depends on how fool-proof you want your claims to be. If you claim you saw a red car today, I will probably accept that without asking for a peer-reviewed scientific study, because the claim isn't extraordinary. But certainly if an extraordinary claim is made contradicting a position which has been thoroughly documented in the scientific literature, I am justified in being skeptical and to ask for more credible (scientific) evidence, no?	1346695871

Equate toxins with "evil humours". Now everyone talking about toxins is a quack. Nice. I especially love the sentence "waste products are metabolized by organs like the liver". Which is just a different way to say that toxins are detoxified by the liver. The liver is a detoxification organ primarily. Go ask your doctor - that is mainstream science. Toxins are created by the bacteria and yeasts in your intestinal tract - and your body can metabolize or detoxify them just fine assuming you are healthy. No need for colon cleansing or detoxifying cleanses thank you very much. I agree - detoxification and cleanses are *totally* abused by the alternative health community. But toxins (be they drugs, pollutants, pesticides, byproducts of our immune systems and metabolic processes, intestinal flora, heavy metals, etc) are real and are a part of mainstream evidence based medicine.	1250656630

Great thanks, though in the modern criticism section there is this line...\n\n&gt;Former U.S. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Alan Greenspan gives most credit to Ludwig Erhard for Europe's economic recovery. Greenspan writes in his memoir The Age of Turbulence that Erhard's economic policies were the most important aspect of postwar Western Europe recovery, far outweighing the contributions of the Marshall Plan. He states that it was Erhard's reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany's miraculous recovery, and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries. Japan's recovery is also used as a counter-example, since it experienced rapid growth without any aid whatsoever.[citation needed] \n\nSo I don't know if it's true or not that Japan did what it did without aid.\n\nStill the Marshall Plan does seem to provide a good example where America has after helping in the military defeat of a country (Nazi Germany) then went on to offer significant aid to that country.\n\n&gt;But some on reddit like to believe it is the root of all evil and can do no good.\n\nYes unfortunately. I'm not one of them though. The American constitution with its focus on individual freedom has had massive positive effect all around the planet. Many countries owe their modern laws, and freedoms that come from them, to the founding fathers of America.	1294751812

I moved to New Jersey in the mid-70s, and there was an experiment going on at Rahway prison for those convicted of child sexual abuse. The goal was not to punish but to treat them. There were media interviews, and the inmates all said the program was wonderful and that it worked. \n\nSome years later, they studied the recidivism rate for those in the program and those not in it, and there was no difference. They abandoned the program.\n\nYour use of sex crimes and sexual offenders is broader than child sexual abuse, so I don't know if it carries over.

Does nano-thermite explode though? I don't think so.\n\nThis whole thermite business is so shady. Ever ask yourself why TNT wasn't found at ground zero, or some other well known explosive? TNT is a really novel molecule, synthesized exclusively for its exploding properties. *That* would be an interesting find at ground zero, since there's really no other reason it would be there than to blow stuff up.\n\nKnow what thermite is? It's a metal oxide mixed with a metal powder. Sound vague? Yeah, because you can make it out of lots of different combinations of metals. Nothing too novel about thermite. Is it that far fetched to think that in all that molten aluminum and iron at the crash site that some metal formed an oxide? Hardly a smoking gun. Truthers just latched on to the one questionable compound that could have reasonably formed on its own.\n\nAnd to top it all off, it doesn't even explode! So silly.	1346071245

&gt; This podcast features a panel of scientists...and Rebecca Watson.\n\nWhere did you get the idea that all of the other panelists were scientists? I've just looked through their bios on theskepticsguide.org, and while they all have credentials listed that show them to be stalwarts of the skeptical community, the only one whose occupation is listed as being in the sciences is Steven Novella (academic neurologist).\n\nThe only other person who's profession and educational background they mention is Evan: "Evan's profession is in television production, and he holds a BA in Communications from Central Connecticut State University. " - so he's not a scientist.\n\nIf any of the others had an education in the sciences, I assume they would have mentioned it.  So I feel confident in surmising that Steven Novella is the only scientist in the group, and the rest are only science enthusiasts.\n\nThis strange contempt for Rebecca Watson, based on these kind of nonsense reasons, is really bizarre.  If you just don't like her personality, I can understand that.  People don't mesh with each other all the time, that's life.  But just leave it at that instead of trying to justify your antipathy.	1330948288

Wikipedia does not agree with you. Night soil is raw human feces and is not even legal to use in the US just as raw bovine feces is not legal to use. You have pathogens in the feces of animals and people, both of them have to get processed and treated before they can be used as manure, and by that time all the pathogenic microbes have died.\n\nAs for you other concerns, we only mandate putting things on labels if it relates to the consumers health. If we were to start mandating that companies include the environmental impact of their products on their labels then we would start with far more important things like carbon footprint, whether or not ecologically important land has been destroyed, etc, before we started including GMOs.	1352435038

I see - apologies, I was approaching it from a different angle (whether the grounding effect worked as they said it did).\n\nTried to find the paper so that we could at least see what that actually says, but I'm not getting very far. Wevers full name is Rutger Wever, and I found hints (but not very firm ones) that the paper was published by Springer-Verlag in "The circadian system of man: Results of experiments under temporal isolation", but that was published in 1979 and appears to be out-of-print - couldn't find any digital copies. Might get it in a library or used if you're curious enough and don't mind the risk that it's not even in there.\n\nAs for the papers on the research page - I'm not qualified in any way to evaluate them properly (especially the health claims), and I wouldn't know where to look for good quality independent medical research. Unless someone else here can help, we're at a dead-end.\n\nEdit: one other thing - I found a lot of references to experiments where Wever put subjects in an EMF-shielded room. I'm wondering if this is what is meant by grounded, since to shield a room like this, you use a Faraday cage, which needs to be grounded (the subjects aren't necessarily grounded themselves)?	1316068219

Well I still don't understand.  Like I said many commenters "took the bait" so to speak, so it seems like the poster was correct that they had the opinion that placebos were bad therapy.  So maybe the poster was making a generally unwarranted assumption, but to the audience of /r/skeptic, it was aptly targeted.\n\nYour example isn't fair.  A placebo is something which by definition is something "fake", but that has a real effect through expectation.  It's therefore reasonable to address a forum dedicated to the criticism of things which are not real to question its value.  George Bush isn't defined by having blown up the WTC, he's defined as an anglo male who served as president of the US.  Positing that he had blown up WTC would be highly dubious assertion to most circles.  That being said, it would have been well-received and therefore rhetorically useful to have made that assumption in /r/conspiracy (although there are some commenters there who would object to the assumption.)\n\nSo why was it a circlejerk again?  The poster said, in effect, "maybe placebos aren't bad."  Most commenters have taken both sides of the question, validating the poster's framing of the inquiry in terms of the position with which he/she didn't agree.	1278099315

At some point, we wont be able to feed everyone and they will be swimming in their own waste. Where that is, I have no idea, but population control is an issue that needs to be addressed. There has to be enough food and a way to get rid of the waste, or use it somehow. \n\nTake a 55 gallon drum, fill it with 50 gallons of water, put in 20lbs of sugar, then add yeast. Can it support 7 billion yeast? Yes, quite easily. As the yeast consume the sugar, they reproduce profusely producing CO2 and ETOH, and eventually when there is between 10% and 20% ethanol in the barrel, the yeast die off in their own waste. If they cant get out and spread to other areas, they will die due to lack of food or in their own waste. The earth is our 55 gallon drum and we are ripping through the sugar pretty damn fast.\n\nWe can find new ways to produce more food, and new ways to use the waste to produce more, but there will still come a point where we cant sustain it. Weather can make that come sooner or later.	1343490869

That information isn't entirely correct. IPCC represents thousands of scientists, and there's like a couple of dozen skeptic scientists (that are dubious as well).

I'll assume you aren't being a jackass -- the point is, he says Bill Nye is throwing ad hominem attacks, when in fact Bill Nye was being completely respectful (while still disagreeing with his conclusion) and then the guy starts in with "Mr. Comedian" which was clearly said in a tone that marks it as an ad hominem attack... Pot calling the kettle black -- even though the kettle wasn't even being black... or something.	1324616811
&gt;Because if an argument only becomes privileged when made by a certain class of people, then I feel that all you've done is admitted that it's an attack on a person and not on the argument.\n\nThat's not what claims of privilege are about. Nobody's opinion becomes invalidated because they are white or male. You seem to be interpreting "check your privilege" as a kind of ad hominem, when it has nothing to do with the person themselves but their biased perspective. \n\nThat is, if a guy is aware of their privilege, and adjusts their argument accordingly (to eliminate all biases and flawed thinking on that topic) then it would be absurd to tell him to 'check his privilege'. \n\nThis is why so many people who understand the concept of 'privilege' get confused when people try to argue that it's used as a way of shutting down discussion or as an ad hominem. It's a way of weeding out shitty arguments and continuing discussion; it only stops discussing if the person who gets called out on the ignorance gets all annoyed and leaves the discussion. In other words, it's like telling a creationist to read a science book. 	1347503324

Billions which, were it not for the alleged false flag of human-caused climate change, could instead have been invested into researching and combating the true cause of climate change, up to and including bonafide terraforming.

You seem to be redefining terms to fit your viewpoint.  It won't be possible to continue the discussion if one party is making up definitions.\n\nSentience and self-awareness are not at all the same thing.  You asked for a definition of sentience, so here is one, from Merriam Webster:\n"responsive to or conscious of sense impressions"\nSense impressions means things like smell, touch, pain, etc.  \n\nI don't understand why you disagree that human sentience comes from the nervous system.  This is not really disputed by scientists.  \n\nMany animals cannot recognize themselves in the mirror, but can still experience pain, as is evident by their responses to injury and other hardships.  Some nonhuman animals can recognize themselves in a mirror, but I don't think that's relevant.\n\nAs I said before, there is actually evidence that bacteria aren't sentient.  Yes, they are alive, but so are plants.  There is no evolutionary reason for plants or bacteria to develop sentience, and since we know that in humans it is the nervous system that provides sentience, it is very unlikely that any organism without a nervous system and without the ability to avoid danger would develop sentience.\n\nThe way bacteria react to environments is much simpler than the way animals do.  Their reactions are on a basic chemical level.  Roombas don't actually have the ability to learn from past situations.  They can only react to current situations, or respond to their programming.  It is conceivable that a robot could be sentient, but I don't think that artificial intelligence is nearly that advanced yet.\n\nYou asked for evidence of animal sentience.  There is a lot.  Here is one particular scientific paper: http://www.springerlink.com/content/p4g44725t17126x0/\n\nSince you seem not to think that animals deserve our consideration, do you think it's okay to torture a cat, dog, chimp, or other animal?	1322013113

As far as the skeptic goes in me, which resides over a larger part of my perspective than the believer does, this is by a far the best supporting evidence for a real and actual aerial phenomena that we don't currently understand.  \n\nThe camera shake was verified but it was only a few arcseconds of the camera shifting during the exposure (as you would expect in a non-mounted night time camera shot). The shaking was not sufficient to make the streak across the sky shown in the picture. This object was also verified to not be the moon or any other known star. \n\nI'm pretty sure day/night superimpositions were made that showed any questionable phenomenon to be clearly airborne. \n\nThere are a few documentaries out that cover the story.

If a labor progresses too long, if a mother gets skittish, if - basically - mom ain't feelin' it, to the hospital they go.  Generally to get a zap of pitocin, which my wife isn't allowed to use or she loses her license to practice.\n\nWhich outlines how patchwork the MANAStats database is - in most states, midwives aren't licensed *at all* so they have no license to lose.  What they'll do in similar situations is put a squirt of pitocin on a cotton ball and put it up in mom's cheek down by the gums, which hustles labor along just dandy.  So suppose you're trying to use the MANAStats database to find out about the use of pitocin in labor.  They'd likely refuse you the data - because a lot of births in their database *did* have pitocin involved, but the data *might* indicate that (if it's legal in the midwife's state, *might not* indicate that (if it's illegal in the midwife's state and they used it anyway) or, worst case, *might indicate that pitocin was used illegally* and therefore, a midwife with the exact same practice modality in Arkansas as they use in New York could end up facing criminal charges simply for participating in the study.\n\nIt's a total catch-22.  Collect the data and risk showing that your members are practicing outside of the scope they've managed to assemble across a patchwork of 50 states... or continue practicing in darkness and never get the laws changed.  And what do they get?  "*Homebirth midwives don't want you to know.*"	1258390917
If you go into court, proof has to lie on both sides or the case is null and void. You can't claim proof to back up one theory, without having proof to disprove another.\n\nAt the end of the day, we are all observers and there will never be the proof needed to prove or disprove.\n\nUntil such times as other life was to pop down and say hello, or Nasa was to find the building blocks of life (but still wouldn't prove other intelligent exists.) Then all skeptics are going to say to get proof that we cannot possibly get yet.	1354274019
Well I can add something to the list on here. Half of our rooms on the ground floor face the parking lot. I've walked by the window for 109 a half dozen times tonight while outside having a cigarette. Its been dark, no one is staying in there, no has been in there. When I was outside just now I turned to flick my cigarette and come back in and thru the sheer curtains I can see that the light on the night stand is on. Will I be going to turn it off? Nope.	1348653118
I presume you believe the computer on which you are writing exists. You grossly oversimplify a complex and fascinating issue by assuming you are even capable of distinguishing your beliefs from what you think you know objectively. Purely epistemic concerns aside, your cognitive apparatus (and mine) does a superlative job of modeling the world, but in a way which interweaves emotion, personality structure and external input. Our reality is intersubjective. You cannot blithely weed out the beliefs from the statements of fact. And adherents of the 'CSICOP' brand of skepticism often have a perceptible personal stake in seeing that the status quo is left undisturbed.\n\nAs to your second point, I reiterate: we simply don't have the intellectual juice at this stage to judge which places a civilisation one million years older than ours might like to visit nor what technology they might have at their disposal.\n\n	1331843013

And while we're at it, here:\nhttp://skepticsannotatedbible.com/index.htm\n\nAll the Abrahamic religions have content in their scriptures that encourage violence.  When followers of those religions feel like being violent, they find those parts particularly compelling.  Never did I say that Islam was peaceful... I ~~said~~ insunuated that all religions are violent and the only reason that Muslims (or, 1/1000% of them) are finding their violent versus meaningful all of a sudden is because of their current geopolitical situation.  	1333855298
I have noticed that many rational people start to develop a dice-related superstition when they play rpgs.

Thank you too.  It's been fun.\n\n&gt;My involvement in the paranormal as a ritualist has been to get rid of it, not to prove it's validity.\n\nThat's the difference between religion and science.\n\nAs a skeptic, it still frustrates me to think people are willing to just assign their beliefs and not investigate what really happened, but I'm far more accepting of that than someone who investigates something and stops looking at the paranormal answer leading people down bad science.	1324657683

All that drama scince elevatergate is so fucking ridicoulus. A while ago i unsubbed from quite a few youtube channels I was subscribled to a long time, something I never did before. Why? The occasional drama vid would be one thing, but there are so many of them I've just grown tired of seeing those faces and hearing those voices. The "old gang" has become very protective of their little clique, and instead of discussing their differences in private, they publicize all their actions in real time on all their channels and blogs. They all do stupid shit, but all sides only see the errors of others and then go on some 5 minute rant about how "we" are all rational and "they" are behaving like creationists.	1345813143
&gt;Again, I never once asserted that he was anti-vaccination.\n\nSo, again, what was the point in saying "Celebrities and Ron Paul" in regards to "evidence against vaccinations"? What else could that have possibly meant other than you asserting Ron Paul is anti-vaccination? That's what the comic portrayed, and that's what you comment portrayed. Like I said before, if I am incorrect in this judgement of your comment, please, let me know.\n\n&gt;He is, however, asserting a public policy that diminishes the effectiveness of vaccination and puts children in danger, **and he is doing so because he doesn't understand how vaccinations work.**\n\nYou keep asserting this, but all you've shown in your articles is that *he is following the libertarian position* on the matter. For his political position he probably values the personal liberty of being able to choose to vaccinate or non-vaccinate over government mandated vaccination.\n\n&gt;So you found the links I provided but you didn't read them. This is a waste of my time.\n\nOf course I read them. If you believe there's something in there that supports your position, then by all means quote it here.

" This individual may have influenced " - this is why you need control group (some people of approximately same body fat and general health) and rigorous experimental set up. \n\nThere was no miraculous increase in respiration (and thus heat output) as well, two times what you have at rest is not that much. I'm not sure what is even being claimed here, TBH. The claims do not appear particularly extraordinary to me, and this 'influences the autonomous neurous system thing' is significantly nonsense as this system will try to keep you alive in any case. People can learn to consciously control a lot of stuff we don't normally consciously control, and there's not that much point in this because 2x metabolic rate is readily obtained in more natural ways like shivering, or if you want, flexing statically. And none of that has anything to do with saying mantras to yourself. 	1349115221

ANYTHING is a homeopathic treatment. That's the beauty of it. No bothering with researching and rigorously testing for side-effects -- you can just whip up some well-known compound in a bowl, dilute it until it's just water, and sell it as "homeopathic."\n\nThe genius of homeopathy is that you'll get harmful effects from overdosing on just about anything -- usually something in the stomach, heart, lungs or any combination thereof. Therefore, the "theory" has evolved so that there is a wide gamut of preparations and concoctions to cure just those ailments, so if one doesn't work, you go on to the next -- paying through the nose every time, of course.	1290373356
I agree with you on nearly every point. Yes it will be virtually impossible to definitively convince her she's not looking at an alien.

Yeah, the treatment your aunt received was certainly conventional, science-based medicine. There's nothing alternative about the correct diet and iron supplements, even though alternative practitioners would like to claim so. Diet actually works, after all ;) The difference is that some alternative practitioners overstate the effect of diet to the point where special diets become a "cure" for cancer (and all cancer is caused by the wrong diet), but that's not what r/altmed is about. r/altmed takes science-based, diet-related mainstream medicine and calls it "alternative" in an attempt to make the rest of alternative medicine look more legitimate. It's a strategy that's been used a lot by a lot of alties before - often in the same breath as accusing mainstream medicine for only using pharmaceuticals to treat disease, which is demonstrably wrong, as your aunt's example shows (diet changes, exercise, physical therapy, etc. are all part of mainstream medicine).	1319487037

Conspiracy theories are such an easy out for people to take. It's much easier to blame shadow governments and immensely powerful organizations for the problems in the world or in your life. It makes you feel like it's not your fault that things are the way they are, that the deck is stacked against you and you never had a chance. \n\nI don't think it's possible to say one thing and convince a conspiracy theorist that they're on the wrong track. The dangerous thing about the conspiracy meme is that lack of evidence or evidence to the contrary is usually interpreted to mean that the conspiracy is even more powerful than previously thought. Anyone who doesn't believe it is either naive or, even worse, in on it. \n\nI think you just need to attack it using Occam's razor and just keep driving home the point that if it's is true why would the secret organizations allow sites like Prison Planet to continue to operate?	1310678215

Parts of everything are bunk.  I make decisions based upon several principles that include: textbook/school education (with a big block of NaCl), clinical guidelines, studies, personal experience, and risk/benefit analysis.\n\nFor example: before going off to school I worked in an office when an older lady (existing patient) came into the office using her cane heavily (she rarely did more than carry it in her left hand, this time it was in her right hand and she was *LEANING* on it).  She spoke with a slur had drooping of her eye and mouth.  I stopped her immediately, had her sit down, and ran to get the chiro in the office, I knew something wasn't right but hey I just had a Biology degree.  He came and called an ambulance who took her to the ER, while keeping her calm.  She was in the midst of a stroke and manipulation would likely have killed her and provided no benefit to her neck pain.  That is as black/white as it can be but it illustrates the point of risk vs benefit analysis.\n\nI always look through my 'skeptical goggles' when reading research papers, be it my field or just something a friend sends me. I always ask myself: who is writing this, why are they writing this, who verified the results, who reviewed it, where is it being published, why is it being published, and what is the clinical impact.  \n\nI recently read &amp; discussed a study about standardizing the material used in transferring gut flora for help with IBD.  It made perfect sense that we should have a standardized colony grown in labs with the proper ratio of bacterium and proper dosage amounts rather than using a family member's flora as the transplant source.  You not only have better results but it is standardized, something that we should have in all fields.	1342795059

Souls (again, not in a religious way), reincarnation, forces of good and evil,  dead relatives/angels looking out for you.  \n\nI am not going to tell you why I believe in all of those things to prove myself to a stranger on the internet.

That is the normal short explanation the issue at hand here (and what normally happens) is what is described by the following quote:\n\n&gt;Dissonance is aroused when people are confronted with information that is inconsistent with their beliefs. If the dissonance is not reduced by changing one's belief, the dissonance can result in misperception or rejection or refutation of the information, seeking support from others who share the beliefs, and attempting to persuade others to restore consonance.	1301253256

As some have said, it could simply be a sleep paralysis hallucination.\n\nIt's up to you to decide whether you believe that the things you see while dreaming/under sleep paralysis/lucid dreaming, etc. are a type of external reality, or simply elaborate mind movies that occur internally only. \n\nFor the sake of fun, let's consider that you have had an encounter with some kind of entity that exists outside of your imagination. From your description, this being didn't seem to have the negativity associated with other supposed succubi encounters I've heard of. She didn't seem as aggressive, for one. Or as evil. You describe her as cute and not all that pushy. That might make her something not quite so bad. I actually have heard of a little test that might show her true colors. Up for a little experiment? Then do this: set up a mirror above your bed, or in whatever direction you look while sleeping in your normal sleep position. Try to contact or summon this entity again, if you think you can. Look at 'her' in the mirror. If she is a succubus, you should see... something. I won't tell you what, since then you might actually conjure it up mentally and spoil the experiment. But if you view a succubus in a mirror, you'll know it.\n\n	1326515249
&gt;2 + 2 = 4 is a declarative abstract statement. \n\nThen there would be no point to using that as any kind of proof of truth.  It would just be "It's true because we say it is".  So either the OP was wasting space, or could have been trying to make a point\n\nAs I said other people have with me here.  I'm sorry you can't accept my experience with them, and assume I was being pretentious.  Whatever.\n\n&gt;I've never seen anyone who goes on the tack that simple math is not absolute who isn't also a pretentious, pseudo-intellectual asshole. Not one.\n\nSounds like a confirmation bias to me...  you see it in me because you've decided that's what I was and there will never be any way I can counter that.  Even though I wasn't.\n\nI was giving the guy several benefits of the doubt created by his own statement, combined with the bullshit arguments I've had to endure here... I wanted to avoid a long drawn out mess like this by calling it out up front.  It seems it can't be avoided either way... either you don't call it out up front and waste time with unstated assumptions, or you call it out up front and get framed as pretentious.\n\n&gt;I was applying your standard for "technically possible" to your scenario.\n\nNo you weren't.  By not accepting what I meant by normal, even though I tried to explain it clearly... even though I later clarified, and you continue to reject it and not address the point with that understanding in hand, you are not addressing my scenario.  You are addressing one of your own creation, and avoiding the original point.\n\n&gt; That it is possible to drum up fantastic scenarios for any given situation that can still fit the level of detail supplied\n\nI disagreed explicitly with that point several times.  Sure, you can argue with the language, but if you try to understand the what the person means, and see that he has tried to address all potential fantastic things... you should treat it is if he has. \n\nI gave you the reason I trotted out my fantastic examples, it was because the OP didn't indicate whether he was considering that kind of thing or not.  If he'd just said "normal", I would have one more clarifying question to confirm that... and we'd be talking about actual issues, not this bullshit.\n\n&gt; but you don't argue in good faith.\n\nEvery step of the way.  You've just decided up front that I'm not, so nothing I can say will satisfy you that I am.\n\n&gt; You tried to cite examples of things that can be proved with 100% certainty that, when using the same logic you applied to simple math, can be shown to not actually be 100%.\n\nYou don't see any difference between actual physical reality that we don't know everything about, and a system of mathematics we ourselves created?\n\nThen we have nothing to discuss.  Concepts and reality are the same to you and we're just not operating in the same universe.\n\n&gt;And really, all you had to say was that it was 100% certain that there could be no such thing as a square circle or married bachelor. Those are straight up contradictions that anyone who tries to argue against is just demonstrably contrary.\n\nI didn't think of those actually, those would have been simpler examples.  However, the God example matched that in my mind.\n\nAlso I stated several times the underlying commonality of those.  If you don't control the whole system, you can't specify things enough to completely disprove anything.\n\n	1320775234

I agree.  In fact, I use this subreddit from time to time for a skeptical perspective, not because I am a skeptic.  I'm not trained in science and logic enough to consider myself a skeptic, though I am working toward such a virtue.

You can't educate everyone about everything. I cannot tell you how many of my friends – all of whom have at least a college education and are by no means stupid – have bought things like homeopathic or traditional Chinese/herbal remedies thinking that they were actually medicine, because they were in the section with all the real medicine at the grocery store and hey it says on the label that it's totally natural and safe! \n\nI'm not saying that this toothpaste stuff should be illegal, because I don't know exactly what kind of consequences would come from using it – but I also don't think companies should be allowed to put whatever they want on the ingredients label, even if it's obviously bullshit ("high vibrational frequencies"? Really?) Now, I did see in another thread that this company also sell something that supposedly treats brown recluse spider bites – and imho, that kind of shit should be illegal, because if someone used that thinking it was actually going to work they could easily end up dead.	1297197658
To turn it around, why would I expect a system to not work well, because when I think of private regulators I think of AAA etc. \n\nThere's a lot of variables, and obviously a perfect system is impossible or close to impossible to achieve in any short span of time, which is why if a Libertarian got into office he wouldn't be immediately shutting everything down.

After having a look at a few of the papers they cite quite a few look like observational studies or small sample sizes. The one with the Aspen Seedlings is a case in point.... 'Because only one treatment enclosure was established for each treatment, differences among groups could not be analyzed statistically.'\n\nThey also seem to be mostly in-vitro and animal studies and that makes difficult to translate how the effects might manifest in humans if at all.\n\nI found a fairly recent review paper (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18359015) and after using meta-analysis etc to look at as many studies as they could find on the subject they came to the conclusion that:\n\n'This review showed that the large majority of individuals who claims to be able to detect low level RF-EMF are not able to do so under double-blind conditions..... The available observational studies do not allow differentiating between biophysical from EMF and nocebo effects.' \n\nThe nocebo effects are particularly interesting in that it seems that when people live near a cell tower they blame any adverse symptoms they have on that..i.e. if they have a headache it's because of 'that damn cell tower' and not because they had a stressful day.\n\nThat kind of ties in to the link you gave as well, as they seem to be blaming everything from headaches to the forests and bees dying out on microwave radiation!	1289236581

I don't accept the report as evidence. The fact that you assumed so and your language here shows you really are a conspiracy theorist. You are part of a very sad and psychologically confused sub-culture. But enough about you. \n\n9/11. People make mistakes in their reports it happens all the time. But until you have evidence that 9/11 had some ulterior motive other than anger at America for trampling on their holy lands then you have no right to say anything and be heeded. The burden of proof is on you. You have clearly misinterpreted the youtube videos and it's pretty sad. A simple read through of [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories) and checking the references within (of which are numerous and credible) should make you skeptic of your own "skepticism." I'd love to believe the government is full of evil secret shit and I'd love to do something about it but I see no proof and no good reason to. Do you seriously think Bush was smart enough to help orchestrate something like that? I used to live in Texas when he was governor, dude's an idiot. Do you seriously think the war in Iraq actually made any economic sense? We spent billions upon billions and we still are in the middle east. If the government was smart enough to orchestrate an attack like this in America you'd think they could plan a decent war. 	1334507612
That sounds amazing, I attempted to join a group here in Anchorage, but they wanted me to pay a $250 "joining fee", wanted to drug test me(not that I would have any problem passing) and wanted me to have two seperate background checks done.

I have had a sleep paralysis hallucination where a black cloud with a lot of electricity pulsing through it hovered above my head on the ceiling. There was also another humanoid entity in the room at the foot of my bed who 'made me aware' of the cloud. \n\nFor years, before I learnt about sleep paralysis, I was convinced I had been cursed by some demonic force and the cloud was the 'subconcious' manifestation of the curse.

Honestly most of the talk on that place seems to originate from some evidence that there are now quasars that have a redshift which might not be an indication of the distance to them or of their real speed - and that for such cases there is an alternative (unproven?) theories that claim to explain things apparently better by also adding some amount of Compton effect or some other effects - however jumping from that to claiming that all redshift in the universe is only from Compton effect and that there is a 'conspiracy' to hide that is just the usual stupid talk that we see from conspiratards ...\n\nEDIT: very likely the standard Compton effect can not explain that ...	1328380305

I've suffered from sleep paralysis since I was a child. It causes a sense of panic, hallucinations, and an inability to move. It is frequently preceded by lucid dreaming episodes. So yes, I'd say this poster was dead-on.\n\nA fundamental tenet of paranormal investigation is to do everything you can to account for rational explanations, and only when you cannot provide one to entertain a possibility of the paranormal. Which is something you should be familiar with, given your tag is Sherlock Holmes, who famously said (In The Sign of Four), "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?"\n\nOr, to reverse that, if you can't eliminate Lucid Dreaming and Sleep Paralysis as possibilities, you can't jump to the paranormal. 	1342118341

Let me answer you by way of a little story of my second class session in archeology; The professor is a well known (in his field) Mayan archeologist, he manages his own long term dig of a major temple and has done a lot of foundational work in interpreting Mayan hieroglyphics. He spent a good 20 minutes of the class session explaining why the whole 'world ending in 2012 according to the Mayan calendar' was bullshit (his exact words) and then went on to ancient aliens and other assorted nonsense. Basically telling us that not everything on the discovery/science/history channel was worth talking about, and that if we brought up any of that stuff in class we would be mocked. He finished by telling us we were adults and should act like adults when approaching knowledge.	1312741103

Right there with you. I tried to just watch the movie as a movie but man did it feel really anti-science and anti-skepticism. Scientists yet again portrayed as people poking their noses where they don't belong. \n\nAlthough I think it can just as likely read as poor writing that resorts to tired rote character decisions that has determined the course of horror/thriller films for decades. \n\nTo be honest Cabin in the Woods made me think even less of Prometheus. I started to think that the something that drove the characters in that were happening to these characters. It made me LOL.\n\nMy most reviled line in the movie is when the "biologist" says "Oh, we're going to overturn 200 years of Darwinism.", I mean we would never hear in a movie that same sentance replaced with Newtonianism, or Einsteinism. Maybe Newtonian Physics or Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. It's just the way that the line is delivered it sounds so perjorative, and as if Darwin is the one being adhered too an not evolutionary theory which has expanded and changed to include new evidence that wasn't available to Darwin at the time.\n\nI know I should just throw my hands up and say its just a movie, but then the film also pushes the ancient aliens theory, even to the point where it implies that the "Engineers" were involved somehow with Jesus. Seeing as it was approximately 2000 years ago when the engineers decided they were going to exterminate Humans for some "crime" which resulted in a disagreement among the Engineers.\n\nSorry about the rant, I just needed to get it out as I was super excited for this film, and on so many levels did it disappoint. However, it looked great and the performance from Michael Fassbinder was superb in fact I was happy when he started passively dispatching the crew. 	1340812819

I think skepticism is a skill that anyone can learn.  I think even something simple like the scientific method, or a flow chart with a few simple steps on it could help anyone to think more critically.\n\nFor example when presented with new information:\n\n1.) Is there any physical proof?\n\n2.) Are there experts in the field who can vouch for this?\n\n3.) Who benefits from me believing this? Is someone making money from selling books, selling a product, etc. \n\nI think most people are skeptical, it just depends how far they apply that skepticism in their life. Deeply religious people will definitely carefully interrogate someone who showed up at their doorstep asking for 20$. What do you need the money for?, do you have proof you are my long lost brother?, etc.  They might unthinkingly give the same money to a televangelist, without asking what the money will be spent on.	1324602905

Personal anecdote:My parents got a chocolate lab puppy,Nestle, the year I was born. We basically grew up together until she passed away around age 14. She would always drink from the toilet in my moms bathroom.A year or so after Nestle was gone, my mom woke up to the sound of drinking in the bathroom. It went on long enough for mom to get irritated and yell. The noise stopped and a minute or two later she gained her wits and checked the bathroom. Unsurprisingly, nothing was there.  There is no way to know for sure that my mom wasn't half asleep and imagining things but it resonated with me nonetheless.	1335638909
I was libertarian for a while. Basically when I first met the idea of Ron Paul. That guy does deserve a lot of respect.\n\nBut travelling to a third world country where it really struck me just how much value a government adds to a society really started me moving away from the more pure libertarian ideals.\n\nI still fully support the personal liberty ideals of libertarianism, but I cannot support the ideals which involve expecting people to fight for themselves when they are down. Compassion really is the thing most lacking from the libertarian ideal (I know, it is meant to be filled in by the average person - I'm just not convinced that works out very well in the end). I want a government that will stop people from being stuck on the street, will stop people from being unable to afford healthcare, and will support the weakest in society at the expense of others - because that is who needs to support the weak!\n\nPrivate systems are just as bloated an inefficient as government ones - but only government systems are *meant* to be for the good of the people, while private systems are *meant* to be for personal profit. Whether governments always succeed at being for the benefit of the people or not doesn't stop the fact that they are at least designed to fulfill that role, while the other isn't even meant to do it.\n\n..I think we got a little off topic here.	1338273948

The Hopkinsville event had multiple witnesses, and the creatures described were quite different, they were not the typical greys which this account seems to be influenced by. These creatures resemble the Hopkinsville entities in only one respect: small humanoids. Also Hopkinsville included a UFO sighting at the beginning.\n\nThis report is from one witness, the report of another witness is anecdotal. The report comes from someone who appears to know a bit about such accounts. The evidence is weak and sending people out there based on this would be expensive and might achieve what a possible hoaxer wants, attention or whatever other validation is motivating them, even just hoodwinking someone for shits and giggles. They really should come up with better evidence than this, given the story so far. \n\nI mean, if this was happening to you, you'd make a bit of an effort to get better evidence, wouldn't you? Admittedly you'd be freaked out, but if you got good evidence, that would be worth a lot, financially and in every other respect. The guy claims to be armed, he doesn't have to go down the "mine" and his family are out of harm's way, so what's the problem? The dodgy photos seem pretty weak given the account of these things coming right up to the house. \n\nNot worth the effort with what has been presented. 	1340273456
 What do you mean? I read the OP and commended on it. \n\nYour comment is typical for a believer, you want to shift the burden from the person making the claim to the person questioning the claim.  It is the author of the article to provide the evidence and to prove the claims.  If the author doesn't understand what constitutes evidence then they are not in an enviable position.\n\nMaybe you should familiarize yourself, with the fallacy of shifting the burden.	1306867999

No, I'm saying that "I didn't suffer trauma from abuse, ergo religion is categorically worse than child abuse" is a pretty fucking atrocious argument. Again, he allows his personal experience to override any other argument and uses only his personal experience to advance his overall agenda, ignoring or downplaying other experiences in the process. All of which is horribly unscientific.\n\nHe could've said "child abuse is bad. But teaching Christianity is also bad, and even worse!" and duked it out on the terms that actually exist. Instead he attempted to redefine child abuse to not-so-bad-as-all-that and preconditions his argument on that being accepted. Shitty argument.	1351098672

Assume there is an amount of food to be able to provide for a population of Y. Let's say the population of some place is Z. As long as Y=Z, there is enough food (When Y&gt;Z, there is a surplus of food). The moment Y&lt;Z there's going to be less food for everyone. Eventually its going to get to the point where there just isn't going to be enough food, because the rate at which food is procured is slower than the rate of population growth. So people starve to death, which brings Z closer to Y again. More people dead, less mouths to feed. Once Y=Z again, the cycle repeats.\n\nAnd water distribution is usually given by aid groups to main cities, which is then distributed to towns, and then from there, people come from the villages to the towns to get water. They can't just "move" there, for the same reason that someone can live in one city, yet work in another.	1268159786

Ask them questions.  Don't spout your beliefs.  Make them do the thinking.\n\nAn easy way to do this is just to take your statements and frame them as questions in a non-judgmental way.\n\n**Example:**\n\nP1:  I'm tired of everyone talking about gays getting married.  God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!\n\n*P2:  What do you feel about the parts of the Bible that talk more about loving everyone regardless of them doing things you disagree with?*\n\nP1:  That doesn't mean they should be able to get married.\n\n*P2:  Who should be able to choose who gets married?*\n\nP1:  God-fearing Americans.  This is a Christian nation.\n\n*P2:  Do Jewish people deserve to be able to get married?*\n\nP1:  Yeah, I don't have a problem with them.  It's just the gays.\n\n*P2:  So maybe it's not so much about religion as it is about what you just feel isn't right?*\n\nP1:  Yeah.\n\netc....\n\n------------\n\nObviously the conversation could go a million different ways, but if approached in this manner you are much more likely to have a productive conversation that gets to what's underneath the superficial beliefs.  It doesn't pass judgement, yet still leads them to think about things in a more critical way.  You may find that you just don't agree, but at least you can find out the real reason *why* you don't agree.  If it had started argumentatively, the conversation would have just been an argument about what the Bible does and doesn't say, which we found wasn't even the real issue here.\n\n\n\n\n**Edit:**\n\n*Just a downvote without any comment after I spent time typing all of that?*	1341561383

You've already given me a fair bit to read, and I'm just an uneducated (really, Creationist schooling and only went to university for a short period before leaving) layman. Though this stuff fascinates me.\n\n&gt;However, if it is learnt, and people suddenly stopped speaking and decided to write everything down, a malleable mechanism like learning could adapt to this, whereas the innate mechanism is more "rigid" in that for it to change it requires an evolutionary shift (which obviously takes a few generations).\n\nOkay, do we have any decisive evidence on this issue? I thought that stuff like reading and writing was harder. But as you've pointed out it can be explained either way, because we don't spend nearly as much time reading and writing as we do talking.	1328529485

That is what alarmist evangelicals like to say, but usually quickly followed by a complete lack of skepticism in anything to do with climate science...

They're talking about manipulating the upper back and neck (also part of the spine). It can help mobility slightly and increase comfort. No, I don't go to a chiropractor, but I do so using either stuff raided from yoga or simply grabbing my head and popping/stretching my neck (I'm sure plenty of people stretch their neck in various ways when it's stiff) and I'm not sure what benefit one would have from having a third party do it beyond perhaps inability to do so oneself or the ability to add massage (hard to rub your own neck/shoulders as well as another person can).\n\nNot sure how risky it is, there are a lot of blood flow through there and manipulating it (in any way) could conceivably "jar lose" stuff or damage something (overextending the neck muscles isn't uncommon especially if they're tight, the spinal cord is there, etc). Can't imagine it's a massive risk, but perhaps they'll continue research and present actual studies.	1339167203

"Just the placebo effect" doesn't exist. To say that the mind is tricked into thinking that the pain is lessened (as an example) by a placebo pill does **not** explain by what mechanism the pain is lessened.

&gt; lol u shitlords don;t come to be educated\n\nI was there to learn.  I asked questions in good faith.  I was shouted down for my temerity.  Believe me or not, but that is the case.\n\nAnd if you think calling people "shitlords" demonstrates a willingness to do anything other than attack your audience, you don't deserve to use the term "hate speech" in a sentence.\n\n&gt;  ur not foolin ne1.\n\nYou visibly don't have any respect for the people you disagree with, nor do you apparently argue in good faith.  That's OK, and I'm glad that you own it.  That said, it's never going to win you any support, nor is it going to help you grow as a person.\n\n&gt; certain forms or speech are banned\n\nIn my case, questions about language use and finer points of the balance of rights between individuals.  That I did not know the fourth-wave-feminism answers to these questions, how they apparently apply to wider human rights issues, and that inconsistencies in these positions _absolutely don't exist_ was sufficient to get me shouted down.  I'm not one to push too hard, so that ended quickly enough.\n\n&gt; it's like if u said that a communist revolutionary party cannot execute praxis because idk they ban libertarians from raising issues at plenums or they bad hate speech altogether\n\nThe question really is, are you planning praxis or are you executing it?  For planning, sure, limit discussion.  If you're trying to execute praxis - seems to be the necessary purpose of a public space - you need outreach, discourse, and education.  Otherwise, you're just impotently spinning your wheels.\n\nIncidentally, the communist party isn't the best example.  They have historically done a terrible job at executing praxis, at least in the US.	1347395913
Companies look to make money. Some of that money is made by throwing money at RIAA lawyers (as tax deductible donation to a trade organization that is commensurate with participation in a given field). It's a no-loss situation. Do the companies proper also try to make money via ad sales selling anything that's popular? Yeah. While there's likely no collaboration between these sectors akin to what we might call entrapment, it's still a shitty business practice to have your free lawyers attack people who aren't your customers. Long term, that's not a great way to get more customers.	1345475077

I have to argue this. If you didn't have companies making sterile crops, and claiming ownership of the intellectual property that produces then we wouldn't have these crops in the first place.\n\nIntellectual property rights are important. What they allows is business to invest in and produce more ideas, new ways of doing things. What incentive is there for a company to innovate if their investment would be copied and under cut?\n\nImagine if they produced seeds for crops that weren't sterile. In two seasons Monsanto would not sell a single seed. It would be cheaper for someone to buy some of their seed just for breeding. \n\nMonsanto would do one or two things from this. The seeds they do sell in the first place would have to be priced at a level that recovers their entire R&amp;D budget (read millions of dollars), or they wouldn't research seeds in the first place.	1335606731

Seriously. I have been to a chiropractor twice, for acute back pain. I can't say it helped completely, but it did for me resemble a massage, which was the only way I could afford one using my insurance (read:free (and at least I thought it was the only way at the time)). Not to mention this chiropractor gave me some light back exercises to do, which I think is more than reasonable advice. It was no miracle cure, but damn it if I did not feel better walking out of the chiropractor's office. \n\nI have never heard of chiropractors claiming they can heal diseases before Reddit, but I guess I'm in the minority. Of course, I would never support that idea, which seems ludicrous. What does seem reasonable to me would be the fact that they can help with minor cases of back pain and posture problems and such. For any serious problems, the obvious answer would be go see a real doctor.  \n\nOn that note: I can understand the rage against homeopathy in this subreddit, as I know people very close to me who believe in homeopathic remedies, and it pisses me off to no ends. I would be more understanding if they were religious. Think about it - at least homeopathy can be scientifically proven to not work, and as far as I'm concerned, it has been not proven to work. I frequently say that for me to be able to accept that homeopathy works, I would have to burn my diploma and forget almost everything I learned about science. In the case of religion, at least it is scientifically impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god (I'm an atheist for the record). \n\nSorry for the long rant and going off topic a bit. 	1310421050

This is the single best argument. If The Big Bang 'theory' is correct, and for the sake of simplicity of argument, there is no multiverse, but just this universe: The universe is around 14B years old, and our own system is around 4B, which leaves an awful lot of room (14B years) for there to be systems that support intelligent life more evolved than our own, given the vastness of its size and the sheer time and cosmic variety of it all. Heck, forget about 1000 years, for all we know there could be civilisations 1B+ years ahead of us, given that we ourselves are around 1B years in the making, there's 13B others years for that to be possible.	1351121502

You seriously linked to someone describing natural selection, as "worship of science", you've got to be retarded.\n\nStrawmanning by pointing out real examples where religious people have started protests over?\n\nThe point of ridiculing religion is to get them to stop getting so offended by it. Similar to how people use to make fun of people who got angry in school when someone insults them, the solution was to not be so offended by it. That's the goal. Religions are so easily offended by everything, and that's only going to lead to violence down the road.\n\nAnd you dislike atheism because it used popular memes like advice animals and facebook pictures to make a specific point or bring to attention a specific issue. \n\nLet me tell you, a lot of subreddits are about to disappoint you (but it's funny that you directly go to magicskyfairy which has all of this).\n\nYou dislike /r/atheism because people show respect to something said by the Dalai Lama?

If we went back in time to the 12th century, they'd hang you for saying you want to interpret a line of Bible as a metaphor. Today's Christians are a lot more modern, so the point of quoting Bibles to them, is to show them, they are good because of modern moral zeitgeist, not because of the Bible (since they don't strictly adhere to the Biblical laws).\n\n&gt;superiority complex\n\nSuperiority complex for believing in evolution, the scientific fact, and being upset that they met people who don't believe in it (AKA uneducated ignorant people)---that's superiority? \n\nNext you'll tell me your math professor has a superiority complex for grading you badly on a math test.\n\nHey [this](http://www.borderofinsanity.com/assets/2012/01/Atheism-vs-Stupidism-atheism-26693291-500-417.png) was on the front page of /r/atheism today.

We certainly can take a lot of meaning from the Biblical texts to our lives because, at the most basic, humans haven't changed over the centuries.

And I do find a lot of value in that.\n\nAnd, as a church community we have our traditions (that have changed over the centuries) to pull from and our community interpretations that have been peculiar depending on the community time and place you're talking about. \n\nThere is value to be had in all of this and much of it is what I still find meaningful in the church and in our religion.\n\nBut all of that value and meaning in the Biblical texts goes exactly as far as what we bring to it. And what we bring to it is an awful lot. No matter how we might desire to read some sort of plain meaning out of the text, we will always end up reading into the text if we attempt to apply it to our modern life.\n\nThe work of Biblical scholars like John Collins and many others has been to get past the mysticism surrounding the texts and really examine them as documents that have come to us over a very long and complicated timeline. As such, the texts can, in a sense, live again when we're able to see them as part of the community that created them.\n\nA homily certainly does provide the members of that church a way to interpret those texts and integrate them into their lives. But that is not the texts themselves. That's the theology of the church tradition and potentially the personal interpretation of the priest creating meaning and layering it back on to the text. That homily still has meaning, it's just not any more or less valuable than creating a homily based on a Shakespeare play or an epic by Homer.	1313135535

What used to happen with wine was that the quality of wine would depend on which field that it was grown in, the quality of the soil, the amount of light, the storage containers. It used to be that if it tasted good, the price would go up, and if it tasted bad, it would be cheap.\n\nThen science happened. Modern producers scaled up their operations, bought in grapes from a wider range of growers, who had also been improving their crop, they refined their process, monitored the quality of the source, blended appropriately.\n\nNow there are still some stonking, expensive wines out there, but cheap wines are no longer cheap because they are bad, they're cheap because they are mass produced, and the quality and consistency is on a relentless march upwards as a result of a scientific feedback loop.\n\nQuite frankly, for most supermarket wines it has become a branding exercise, where you pay more for a name than the content, much like most of the stuff we buy nowadays.	1302966737

* Clearly, there is some disagreement about the "general use" of the word "drunk." It is not as obvious as you've made it out to be. Watson made the effort to define what she meant by "drunk" multiple times. So, when there is confusion about what *she* meant, do we defer to her definition, or to an outside definition? When a biologist is talking about the *theory* of evolution, and there is confusion about the meaning, do we defer to the biologist's definition or the "general use?"\n\n* I really don't see her definition as special. She's not the only one that says a drunk person cannot consent. For example, my state university's sexual assault policy states that a person under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol is not able to give consent. So, it would be a stretch to call this a special or extremist position. You can question the validity of policies like these, but it's the codified status quo in places.\n\n* She can later say whatever she wants and have it questioned, yes. However, it's clear to me that the later tweets were her **reiterating** the same concept over and over. These were a **continuation** of what she was saying, not the start of some whole new conversation, completely devoid of context. If there was any confusion about the tweets, she **made a blog post** to clear things up. The tweet is part of a **context**, and to ignore what she said both before and after is foolish and/or intentionally dishonest.	1356045520

Healthy cells very rarely actually hit the point at which telomeres become the dominant factor in their dysfunction. More common is that cells cease being able to reliably reproduce vital sections of genetic code, leading to impaired metabolic function and frequently one of many types of programmed cell death. In order for a cancerous cell to become "immortal" however, it must have a modified ability to replenish it's telomeres.\n\nThe "self destruct mechanism" is actually not one mechanism but many mechanisms. By means of these mechanisms a cell can detect if it's genome is damaged or replicated improperly, or if the cell's physical integrity has changed, or if the cell is unnecessary, or even if some of it's error checking mechanisms are not working properly. These self defense mechanisms can work by halting the cell's metabolic processes or by activing other processes. It's a complex system which usually requires multiple mutations in multiple (often redundant!) genes, both genes which check for errors and genes which regulate growth and reproduction. \n\nAs a consequence there will never be a global cure for "cancer", because cancer is a name for one of thousands upon thousands of different types of cellular dysfunction.	1305334953

&gt; Do you have something other than assertion and suspicion to justify this.\n\nNot sure what evidence I should provide for this.  Typically, if an "agressive" intervention is uncommon in a society, there is little desire to fund lots of studies to see if there is a benefit of that procedure.  Because circumcision is common in the US, there was a lot of interest in figuring out whether there is a benefit of process that was occurring commonly but the AAP had not recommended since 1971 (which was the first time it talked about (I think)).  And if you look at [AAP's report from 1999](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap1999/), you can see the length of the section on UTI (approx. 1450 words long) versus the section on STDs (approx. 146 words long).  This reflects that the latter studies are a more recent suggestion.\n\n&gt; Males retain ability to orgasm, females do not.\n\nThe studies are mixed on both these.  There are several reports of reduced penile sensitivity and delayed orgasms in circumcised males.  There are also reports of females happily having orgasms after FGM.  But since this is not my primary area of interest, I don't know where the overall opinion lies in these.  I agree the intention in the case of FGM is reprehensible but the intentions in the male side are often (a) religious, (b) a desire to fit in, (c) a desire to look like Dad's, (d) health concerns - and (d) is much less frequently the intent compared to the other three.\n\n&gt; I'm not necessarily a proponent for male circumcision, but I do think the hullabaloo is much overwrought.\n\nI am not certain about the value of circumcision and therefore was looking forward to the AAP's recommendation.  The press release was a bit hyperbolic for my taste and therefore I mentioned that.  I hope I did not come across as too militant.  The reason for the general hullabaloo is that it is not (a) a societal norm in most of the rest of the world, (b) the intention is suspect in a majority of cases, and many countries are more sensitive about a child's rights than Americans are (rightly or not), and (c) it is the internet - only the loudest and the most motivated survive.	1346088570
I just realized your condescension was all based on an entirely incorrect understanding of Argumentum ad Ignoratium.\n\nArgumentum ad Ignoratium is NOT the concept that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."\n\nIt is actually the concept that absence of contradicting evidence is not proof.\n\nThe two are very different ideas; in fact they insinuate opposing conclusions. You clearly are someone who gets off on correcting people's logic - and not actually displaying good logic - if you just assumed without learning about or so terribly misunderstood Argumentum ad Ignratium. You effectively turned the entire concept on its head and attempted to argue that it suggests the opposite of what it does. I can't believe I argued with you at all about it.\n\nThe teapot analogy perfectly explains why you can safely say Bigfoot doesn't exist.

This is really quite extraordinary the vividness and amount of detail you experienced in your dream. It kind of seems like from what you described that it might be very possible that this vision much like your last could be two years before the event (if it does occur). At least, I think, everyone can take a small breath of relief that it's not anything happening at the end of this year. Still though, I feel very concerned myself about this very likely going to happen and I live in southeast PA which would be relatively close in proximity to this event should it be as large as you describe. \n\nI would say first that I [with my current knowledge base] cannot think of any reason for a volcanic event of such large a magnitude to occur on the east coast of the U.S. . There is no volcanic activity hereabout whatsoever really. Even our mountains, the Appalachians, are very old short mountains without any kind of circumstances that would cause or even presently have anything volcanic going on. And, from your descriptions, it sounds like the lava was coming from the coast/ocean, which is just as weird since there is equally nothing volcanic there. The only thing that would even maybe have something happen volcanicly would be the Great Atlantic Rift, but only I would think if it were affected by some outside source to open into the Earth far enough to expel magma (if that's even possible, I don't know; I just know it's a very large and deep crack from back when the continents separated), but even so the rift is in the center of the Atlantic and seemingly too distant for you [if such an extreme circumstance were possible] to see lava even in Rhode Island. This would lead me to believe something more along the line of an external event, like a meteor; if it were large enough, and went deep enough on impact, AND was close enough to your house in Rhode Island- then maybe that might bring about the circumstances in your vision, but I can't be sure. I would think though it would at least coincide with your hearing a bizarre explosion.\n\nAlso, and I hate to even mention this, but if perhaps what you saw as lava *wasn't* lava but instead something that looked very similar to lava but different, maybe it could've been like a sort of wall of fire and rock that would be reminiscent of what you would see emanating from the center of a nuclear explosion. Perhaps comparing some videos or written accounts of nuclear explosions to your own vision experience might tell you if the possibility of a nuclear explosion is something that might fit the circumstances of your premonition or not.\n\nI'm not sure what else could be possible, but maybe looking into written accounts of meteor impacts or accounts of nuclear explosions might tell you if either of those are likely possibilities. And surely, if some other possibility comes to my mind I won't hesitate to post it :). 	1354820197

I should clarify: I was talking more to the "Cafeteria Christian", the person who is in their religion because they were born into it, and while is not particularly devoted to it...still identifies with the beliefs therein. \n\nMy wife is a great example of this, she's nearly a deist to be honest...she certainly doesn't embrace much of Catholicism, even though that's the checkbox she selects. Rather, she lives by the Golden Rule and typically uses religion and church as a baseline in her life, and a source of tradition and community. The "lack of evidence" to support the ideas of God and Jesus and all that aren't a big deal to her so much, because she also is able to acknowledge that her beliefs might not be true. But they make her a happier person, and she gets something out of them.\n\nI think most religious people are like that, to be honest. Fundies and Evangelicals are the corner cases, and they do indeed have many of the same traits that we've talked about in this thread.	1337362582
The fundamental rule of skepticism is, IMO, "Kiss my ass!"\n\nDo skeptics even realize how difficult it would be for them to set a standard for belief? I mean, if all skeptics got together in Vegas for a week and sat down and said, "Fine. What would it take for us to believe in aliens?"\n\nThe answer that they'd eventually come up with, is that they'd believe in aliens if they came down here and kissed their asses! What if the aliens don't want to do it their way? They're busy. They have alien shit to do, and some skeptic convention is saying "We'd believe in you if only ____." \n\nSome people just like to mock the world from armchairs. Let them have their fun.\n\nAs for you, if you think about it, no you wouldn't carve your initials in a tree. But what *would* you do? You know some humans, you've been to Earth a few times. You were born here. What do you think an alien would have to do? What do you think an alien's message would be in the first place?\n\nEDIT: Changed pronouns.	1351877633
Terrible parents. But from a pragmatic point of view (and one I doubt even crossed their minds), there is no healthcare in this country. Who gets a manslaughter charge for someone who is too poor to afford life-saving healthcare? No one.\n\nThe whole crux of this system of healthcare is you get what you pay for. If you can't pay for it, you don't get it. Sure, hospitals are obliged to take you in if you show up, but *only long enough to ensure that you're vitals are stable*, then they can kick you out back on to the streets.\n\nSo what is the difference between opting out voluntarily in paying healthcare versus someone who simply can't afford it? Should a mother who can't afford to get her kid, say, an organ transplant be charged with manslaughter if her kid dies because of it?\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I am not defending "faith healing" at all. It's ridiculous. What I am saying is that this situation is only slightly different from someone who simply can't afford healthcare. The only difference (if you ignore the neglect) is that these presumably had enough money to seek professional care.\n\nIt's food for thought, and something I doubt many people have really considered. Opinions?	1320364568
For a skeptic you seem very sure of that. What makes a good conspiracy is that you can't be sure of the validity. Some are more reasonable than others, but the key is plausable deniability. For instance, take uaps, there is only eye witness accounts and folks like Peter Hellyer (ex Canadian defense minister), et al, who claim the phenomenon is legitimate. Then there are people who claim there are lizard people controlling the world... one of these conspiracies is not like the other when approached with a skeptical mind.	1332300485

I think it is a disingenuous argument used by people who are against nuclear power under all circumstances.  \n\nFirst, it was "You'll have to glowing two headed babies!", and now that people are realizing that was a lie, it is "Hey, wind and solar are just around the corner!"\n\nSolar and wind are great...but they have to be paired with an "always on" technology...especial if we want to move away from oil and look at an electric auto fleet.  Solar and wind are still emerging technologies, and will require huge infrastructure investments to power a country.  Those investment will occur over decades, and won't begin in earnest until the technology settles out.\n\nSo, it is at best naive to say we can water for wind and solar.  At worst, it is as dishonest as glowing two headed babies. \n\nNuclear is the best "always on" technology.  The 104 anitquated, underdeveloped, underfunded, much maligned 70's era nuclear reactors in the USA still produce about 20% of the electricity.  Carbon neutral, with a minimum of pollution or environment damage.  If the US had kept building reactors with increasingly modern technology, no telling what degree of energy independence the US would enjoy today. \n\nAs for safety, ask a miner or a roughneck how safe conventional power is.  	1276285492

Now I get what you are talking about.\n\nI guess you see fighting for acceptance of atheists in the public sphere and the subsequent legal challenges as inherently political.  Ok.  \n\nHowever, that is atheist organizations promoting atheism on pretty strict legal grounds, not atheist organizations fighting for some VERY broadly defined thing such as social justice... Which literally every single person alive has a different definition of, whether atheist or not.  \n\nIf your point is that the so-called new atheism has already set a precedent of meddling in political and social issues therefor atheism+ should not be argued against because they want to do this; then I think you are mistaken.  \n\nSeparation of church and state, creationism in classrooms, public displays of religious symbols,.... all of which are well defined legal issues dealing direction with the intrusion of religion and suppression of atheism (and science).  Whereas the stated issues of atheism+ are generally non-controversial, what 'social justice' actually means to the group/individual that is the problem.  \n\nThere are  loads of social justice issues done by individuals in the 'new atheist' movement but these are individual decisions about the issues and what needs to be done.  It isn't a group deciding, dictating to their membership and punishing dissent.   	1346564414

Rather shortsighted. You're really only focusing on the States as the only area of import.\n\nPseudo-science aside, there is a chance for catastrophe: the hype. Man's history is replete with rash judgements. Notably, in this particular case, we have reports of wealthy (super-wealthy) folk buying apocalypse-proof condos to weather (whatever) may happen during this time period.\n\nIf any of you care to take the time to think about it, those with exorbitant amounts of wealth have always held power over the general population (in various forms). One particular point of interest in our time period, is the ease of sharing information within closed circles. \n\nHolding that in mind, let's go back to wealth = power. The rich elite surround themselves with like-minded and equally influential people. Like themselves, each of these elite is privy to certain fragments of intel (respective to their communities) which is in turn gabbed about through their elite group. Swapping occurs; mostly of "higher-up" rumors or whathaveyou. I've been privy to these conversations as of my vocation. I cater to many, many richer-than-sin folk. \n\nI'm willing to bet that if we do see anything on an apocalyptic scale, it will be of the persuasion of an 'insurance policy.'\n\nWe've all heard that the super-rich are all for the idea that the population should drastically decrease as for longevity and 'strengthening' our species.\n\nSo what would happen if all these blokes were to head underground for an event of cataclysmic scale, only to be left there without any actual event every occurring? Enter the insurance policy; a tactical nuclear strike on a tumultuous region would ensure MAD for all those above-ground.\n\nI am vehemently convinced that any detrimental event will be of the manufacture by the elite groups of the world.\n	1348337141

Obviously the socioeconomic factors hinted at in that paragraph could have entire libraries written about it, but, putting it simply...\n\nWhat I was getting at was that it's harder for black people to get into postions of economic power, so they choose to go into sport instead. This is also probably related to the stereotypes mentioned later - white people are seen as naturally smarter, black people as more naturally athletic - and contributes to the issue.   \n\nAs for the mini golf - you've missed the point. The experiment shows that both groups performed equally well, until it was mentioned that it was a test of natural athletic ability. When white people felt they were being tested for natural athletic ability which they perceive themselves as not being so good at, their performance plummeted.	1345049890

Wow that's alot of information haha, got lost in there.  But let's go in order of questions here.  \n*Can you describe this fellow in a more anatomical sense?*\nThe fellow in an anatomical sense was to say very chaotic I guess. Like I mentioned, he seemed to take on a different form each time that I've seen him, such as a dragon, a man in a suit, a man in a king's battle arraignment, a man with an antelope's head,  a feral, coyote-like, anthromorphic creature, and a man in a suit, this time with what appeared to be dreadlocks.\n\n*How did he move?* He usually made very slow gestures, unless I approached something that I would sense that he wouldn't want me to touch.  His movements then would become erratic and jerky, like a human that is heavily under the influence of cocaine.\n\n*What were his outlines like?* I'm not sure what you mean by this, but he seemed to never have an outline, he was just a mass of shadow and black, so if he did have one, I could not discern it.\n\n*What kind of sounds could you hear?* Most of the time, the dreams would have a hissing sound, and if i remember correctly, in the city dream I heard what seemed to be a sparking sound, like you hear from a fuse on a firecracker.\n\n*What did you get from the Oujia board?* I didn't receive anything, but what I heard from my girlfriend is that she made contact with a ghost, but she felt threatened by the presence, so she stopped.  She tried again later the board simply said bad, over and over again, so she stopped for good then.\n\nAs for about me, my birthday is on December 5th, 1991.  I love art, and I love music, and I smoke cigarettes.  Things that I don't like are centipedes, basements, overly-zealous atheists and religious fanatics. I usually will talk about anything with anyone really, so long as they're comfy with themselves.  I'm a very outgoing person, and I love to socialize.\n\nUsually my dreams are half of the time about people I know and having a good time, or making a bad time for me better by changing things to make it appeal better to me.  My favorite colors happen to be violet, sage, and yellow, and my favorite number is 17. As for the thoughts, as of lately my thoughts have been about my recent ex, so I can't really give much leeway on that question.\n\nAs for the correspondences, Chicago is to the East of me, Ravens are my favorite bird, I get in trouble alot, Roses are in the garden in the front, I smoke *cloves* in my cigarettes( if that counts), and I love my life for others, so unselfishness I guess also fits.\n\nAs for the things in the numbered bullets, that is where it confuses me.  If you could go into detail on what you mean by these fetters.\n\nAs for the way I feel around him, it's a terrifying comfort.  It's really hard to describe it other than that. 	1343005667

Going by that article, because Deepak Chopra and many other quacks put quantum in front of everything, the whole field is bullshit. Post-modernism fuels a lot of new age and other crap, but it's a tool. I don't blame a hammer when I fail to fix my computer with it and banish it forever from my toolbox.\n\nIn history, area I'm most familiar with, post-modernism can be very useful, and even there it produced bullshit. Still, in its very basics it is just the rejection of a single, dominant narrative (be it western, masculine, nation-state, whatever). It is not that the stone drops different for white European man than it does for black African female. It is that they might perceive and interpret it differently. Unless, that is, they use the tools of modern science. Sure, it can, even should, be viewed as just another viewpoint, but a privileged one because no matter the cultural background it gives same results. By that virtue, even if modern science is western in origins, it is still universal.\n	1323501824

Yes and no. I was actually thinking about that today and my first thought is that we'd see a lot more Arab scientists and economists is they were also give the kind of opportunities Jews have had in the modern world. If they found careers and got into colleges more by merit than by who they and their parents know, and if the oil wealth of the Gulf was invested into science and research rather than in the pockets of royals and their spawn, they would also perform quite well.\n\nLikewise, the disproportionate amount is rather slight since Nobel Prize winners in this category come from a very wide variety of ethnic backgrounds. I'm sure that the relentless focus on study and achievement helps but we also need to think about access to the resources and opportunities here.	1313632253

That disc player 'trick' was atrocious, not helped by the magician himself being awful.  \n\nIf he'd made them properly portable it would have been more interesting but having them attached to speakers just gave far too much avenue for simple electronic shenanigans.  In actual fact, one of them kicked in *far* too fast for a cd player which made me think there was an MP3 player concealed somewhere.\n\nNow, what I'd like to do it take it one stage further.  Ask them to bring in their own CD... and you give them a specially designed CD player which instead of just playing the CD, also transmits it wirelessly to the player on stage.  They, from their seat, choose a CD, and place it in the player, you can then "magically" guess which track they're going to play, and burn the first 30 seconds or so for later use in the trick...\n\n...

It's pretty rare that you hear the science writers for a paper actually called on how shitty a job they do. But in those instances, I've always found the answers depressing. Even in papers I'd have considered fairly reputable, the science reporters seemed to just display an outright ignorance of how science is actually performed. They seemed to obsess over the idea of a story. That opposing viewpoints had to be represented, and that the effects of an experiment were as subjective as the pros and cons of any political party. 	1300610859
There was an article around a few days back covering the effectiveness of drinks like Gatorade in terms of how they can improve an athlete's performance when they're essentially just sugar water. The gist of the article was that it wasn't the sugar giving the drinker more energy, but triggers in the mouth letting the brain know that something sweet was incoming, making the drinker happier. They discovered this by having their test subjects swish the drink around in their mouth and spitting it out, then go for a run.\n\nHow does this map to this particular concern? Apparently when the testers did the same with diet drinks, they got no benefit from it. It would seem that your mouth knows the difference between real and fake sugar, and doesn't let your brain know if it's dealing with the latter.\n\nNo source once again (can't find the article) but I remember reading it exactly because they made that distinction, and the whole taste-sweet-gain-weight is something I've heard and wondered about before as well.	1312562376

How so? From the tutorial explanations on that site, all I can tell is that without rainbowing, it was not likely edited with an adobe product (photoshop). So maybe gimp, but you'd expect brighter dots around the area that's different (edges) while the rest is relatively smooth, which I think is expected (but those ELAs are a bit hard to read to me).\n\nIs it that the background's black in the ELA instead of more distorted? It's an image from January according to the meta-data so it's likely been saved more than once which might account for that.\n\nI'd say it's more likely a lens flare or reflection on glass (taken through a car window?) then a digital modification.\n\nMy guess would be an i-phone taking a picture of a cloudy sky through a car window near a traffic stop at a red light, with the red light oddly reflected off the glass, maybe reflected in a drop of water.	1345596823

You obviously refuse to even acknowledge that I've made this point, as shown by your refusal to respond to it, and your continued insistence that I have no proof.

I certainly agree with your intentions here and wholeheartedly agree.  \n\nJust to make sure though, as I have several times run across people relating this but meaning something else.  Equivalent would mean no change in social behavior, actions or expectations.  IE... boob, dick, fart, &amp; vagina jokes are still perfectly acceptable and humorous.  Commenting on the hotness of other females or males as the case may be again are perfectly acceptable and encouraged.  Such statements made would require a positive response from the female of this group as well as positive participation.  Hitting on any other female outside the group is perfectly acceptable, just not the on currently interacting in the group.  \n\nI'm only being a bit satirical in the above.  What the group always ends back at is that men and woman simple aren't the same.  They interact differently, not just within their own gender but across genders.  What's acceptable behavior in a group of women isn't acceptable within a group of men and vice versa.  Anytime they mix, conflicts will arise.  This isn't inequality, this is just differences\n\nAgain I wholeheartedly agree with your intentions, my experience though has been that because this isn't a as straight forward as you've put it, it gets complicated.  What if the one of the males is genuinely attracted to one of the women in the group?  What if the woman is genuinely attracted to one of the males?  If men hitting on women is verboten so is women hitting men.  Equal is equal, after all.  Can there never be a proposition for a date between the two sides?  There are goals that are at odds with in the members of the group and this causes conflicts internally and externally.  \n\nIn your scenario of black men and white men there's much less conflict in goals, humor, needs, desires, &amp; expectations are much more similar.  The chance that the black man will be offended if a white man hits on him is rather lacking as genders are the same.  \n\nKarsh\n       	1325799477

There was a This American Life a number of years ago about a woman who was told falsely she had Aids by a nurse (the nurse then told her to join Hope Ministries ) hoping the woman would join the church, reform from her evil lesbian ways and, I guess, get miraculously cured.

This isn't really the best argument. Cell phones, electronic games, and laptops are all grossly more engaging than books and magazines. It's the same reason the "well cell phones shouldn't be illegal in cars because you're allowed to talk to other passengers and listen to the radio" arguments don't hold water. It sounds like a good argument on the surface, because it's easy to say "thing 1 is a distraction, thing 2 is a distraction, therefore they are equal..." but they aren't. I'm not saying these things aren't also a distraction, but in an emergency, the difference between having your ears open/throwing a book or magazine down, vs. having ear-buds in, having a phone at your ear, or being grossly engaged in texting are not equivalent. Claiming that perusing skymall takes as much of your focus and attention as playing a video game is silly. Saying reading a book allows you to tune out potential emergency communications as effectively as having music physically playing in your ears or a phone conversation in your ears is also silly.	1356952477

&gt;I definitely share your concerns about his being a UFO nut and coming forward with the story later. \n\nWell, I understand what you mean, but I wouldn't say he was potentially a UFO *nut*, my view is that everyone is prone to self deception and memory distortion, not just crazy people. Memory is very tricky and weird. This guy didn't milk the convention circuit or write a book, so I think he's free of that. I was trying to be very circumspect in my earlier comment. It's possible he could have been exposed to the subject and at some point disparate memories were conflated unconsciously.\n\nI mention the late emergence of the story really only to play devil's advocate, because this is what critics will do, I don't want to speculate on his motives. What I ask for is corroborating evidence. We have partial corroboration in that he really was at Roswell during that period, which should give him the benefit of the doubt. \n\n&gt;a small detail I think lends weight is that there was apparently not as much debris as one would expect from a full craft.\n\nThat's a good point. This is what I mean by the note of veracity, the variance of the details from other accounts suggests authenticity. \n\nThe other thing is the description of the occupants. He describes them as oriental looking, with parchment like skin which was wrinkled. If he was confabulating, he's much more likely to use the ubiquitous grey alien description, which really doesn't date much earlier than the '70s in terms of its emergence in the UFO literature, and gets big only after Communion. \n\nWhat is interesting is that descriptions of 'oriental' looking aliens with wrinkled skin does appear a few times in some early accounts. I can't think offhand of the cites for this, but if I find them I'll post them. In any case, it's details like this that look more like a true account than a fake one.	1333964382

You'll be completely okay :) If you still feel that urge, I think the best option for you is to go to a regression hypnotherapist in search for an answer. If you feel that you ruled out enough medical reasons for your 'condition', I think that would be next logical step. In hypnosis you might be able to explain these happenings, it might also help you to get rid of it if you so wish. However, there is no guarantee and it will cost some money.

I think most theologians would argue that it's not reasonable to choose a definition for the word "omnipotent" that is inherently paradoxical.  So, the word needs to be understood in a nuanced fashion that avoids the paradoxes.  Then, it's safe to say that God is omnipotent, at least insofar as this argument is concerned.\n\nAlso, some things can seem paradoxical, although one could reasonably argue whether they "actually are."  Wave-particle duality, for instance, has always seemed deeply paradoxical to me.	1299275006

This is not my area of expertise but the WSJ quotes that "The combo vaccine produced just one additional fever-related seizure for every 2,300 doses". So if I understand it correctly it's not the difference between 1 in 2,300 seizures and none at all. It seems like seizures can happen both ways with a tiny increase in chances for the combo vaccine.\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/health/2010/06/28/giving-mmr-chicken-pox-vaccines-separately-cuts-already-slight-seizure-risk/\n\n\nHerd immunity does carry some risks but the overall benefit to society is huge. One child might have a seizure but the repercussions of lots of children not getting vaccinated "just in case" is enormous.	1330082591
This is the first time I've seen the statistics on how and why vaccines are being refused, and frankly, it makes me not only alarmed, but extremely angry.\n\nWhy we allow "nonmedical exemptions" for immunization is beyond me.

Well I wasn't suggesting that there is a current therapy for ADHD of this kind, just that the suggestion a therapy couldn't be formulated because it's a "brain disorder" is necessarily and demonstrably false - the autism example. \n\nOn the therapy for ADHD though, I feel you're being a little pessimistic. I'm not sure I know of any applied behavior analysis program that is designed specifically for very young children with ADHD, so I'd doubt the scientific validity of whatever program you're referring to. More importantly, whilst there are no fully developed programs to help people with ADHD, there are a number of methods which have proven effective (for example, certain behavioral techniques to maintain on-task behavior) and we know how to implement them so that the effects are permanent. The medication is still important though, given that it's difficult to teach someone something when they're struggling to take in the information you're feeding them, so you can't train someone to stay on-task when they won't stay on-task for long enough to learn how to stay on-task.	1348288020

The thing is that the simplest explanation is not always the right one, sure when given a lack of evidence for two contradictory hypothesis it makes sense to support the one that requires less hoops to be jumped through, but if you think Quantum Mechanics was a simple solution to the problems facing physics in the early 1900s, then you would be mistaken. In this case it's reasonable to operate under the assumption that there is no creator (for the reasons you outline, among others), but to keep in mind the fact we cannot at this time *know* there was no creator.	1325889239

Just a note about firing clients.\n\nI'm an accountant in public practice. I am always willing to fire a client. I have to be; if the client is difficult, or wants me to assist in committing fraud, I have no problem getting rid of them.\n\nThere seems to be this lingering idea from the 90s that the customer is always right, so business owners will bend over backwards and lose money because of a demanding client. \n\nHere's an example. A client contracts you to do a job. You figure it won't take more than 5 hours, your costs are $50 an hour, and you bill $100 for an hourly profit of $50.\n\n Because the client is a pain in the ass,  he ends up taking 30 hours, and won't pay you more than the $500 you quoted. No biggy, you just write off the $1,250 and figure repeat business from him will make up for it, right?\n\nWrong. You also lost out on other clients that you could have serviced so not only did you lose $1,250 in time on this client, you also lost $1,250 in profit you could have earned from less difficult clients. Difficult clients are always difficult, and are quite often a net loss for you.\n\nNobody is legally required to provide services to someone. Never let yourself be bullied by someone who is costing you money.	1350314207

&gt;What evidence can lend itself to what is universally normal and healthy, and what is abnormal and needs to be treated?\n\nThis is covered in any intro to psyche class. Abnormal behavior is typically looked at by comparing an individuals behavior to the behavior of people of their culture, without any real "universal" standard of normality. Abnormal or aberrant behavior is not considered inherently good or bad, if you grew up somewhere where nobody exercises, but you exercise because it is good for you, then you would be exhibiting abnormal behavior because the norm of where you grew up was to be a couch potato.\n\nMuch of psychology has implications in marketing. Many psychological phenomenon can be empirically observed, such as noticing that the longer somebody waits on hold, the longer they are willing to wait, or observing unit bias in food.\n\nYou can look up psychological experiments and see that they are scientifically done such as in [illusion of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control) where people believe if they flip a coin they are more likely to get the result they want than if somebody else flips it, even though the chance is the same.	1345680493

I don't see how I was duping people.  I listed the different types of doctors you could see if you had back or neck problems (the question asked).  I never said which one to visit out of those.

No, I just have sympathy for all people in equal measure, I don't know of anyone in particular who is a homeopathic "user", but I can see parallels between this and how people regard the religious, or people invested into other pseudosciences, or w/e. I guess my point is that, while it is true that the unknowning must, at some point, at least _try_ to learn -- that is, they are not fully innocent. However, we are the bearers of knowledge, demonizing and dismissing is not effective. These people are engaging homeopathy for _a reason_, it's more effective in the long run to find out _why_ the homeopathic user is using for a reason, the religious person is religious for a reason, these are mental-drugs. Homeopathy "makes you feel good" -- because homeopaths treat them like friends, and not like machines (which can often occur with proper doctors). People are religious because it _makes them feel good_, because they have a community, a safety net. \n\nPeople use these off-beat brain alter-ers because it provides them with some benefit they are not otherwise getting -- they must, or else why would they do it? What is it that they _need_ to go to the homeopath or the preacher for? \n\nI'm a mathematician, but I'm also an engineer. I can only see things through these lenses, and it seems that the obvious way to dismantle something safely and effectively is to understand it. We cannot understand _why_ religion or homeopathy is effective without first understanding _what_ it means to the people who use it. I _hate_ the fact that so many are fooled by pseudoscience and stupid religion (and not all religion is necessarily stupid, but this is another discussion), but -- while it is true that some responsibility is on the mark and not the conman -- it is more important to understand that even mis/uninformed people are still people, and thus cannot (and should not) be dismissed as "stupid."\n\nI feel like I'm not doing a good job of explaining my position, but it's been a tiring day...	1269302457
&gt;But major feminist organizations often support that status quo.\n\nCan't agree with that at all.\n\n&gt;Feminists have spearheaded the reforms in domestic violence law that have created the present situation (extra-judicial punishments, lack of due process, ease of false allegations for material gain, etc).

The reforms have made sure that abusers get punished, that loopholes are stamped out, that victims get the support they need and aren't pressured, etc. What laws or reforms do you think have been introduced which add extra-judicial punishments, lack of due process, or make false allegations possible? At the very least, we know that all of those claims are false in terms of rape.\n\n&gt;I think the issue is that many of the inequalities which favor women are actually supported and propped up by feminist organizations.\n\nHow so? Examples of such organisations doing so?\n\n&gt;Which is why I think an MRM is valuable, even if they can be a bit unhinged at times. But then again, there's plenty of unhinged rhetoric in the feminist movement, as well.\n\nYou'll get extremists everywhere, but the feminist movement as a whole does have a much more solid philosophy and obvious goal with benefits, whereas the MRM seems to be a much more haphazard amalgamation of various people and approaches, which tends to weaken their cause. \n\nI think it would certainly help if the MRM could set up a kind of core set of beliefs; for example, stamping out misogyny in the group, pushing for greater education on what feminism is and why it shouldn't be opposed, why men should avoid discussing these issues as if they were a minority group, etc. It would lend a lot of credence to their position but, as complete speculation, I think if they exclude the misogynists and people who don't understand feminism or civil rights theory, then they'll be left with very few members.\n\n	1345176572

My best guess:\n\nIn the video, he does something strange when he takes the paper from Sharon where he appears to unfold it. After he shows it to Howie, he looks directly at it just long enough to read it.\n\nThere's really no other reason I can think of for him to ever take the paper from her unless he was going to read it at some point.	1343179424
Aside from the obvious blunder that you can't fit the sun in a carton, this infographic is accurate.

Y'know, just about 2 days ago, I did that exact same thing since we're working on a universal influenza vaccine. We did the following experiment just to see if there'd be any interesting results that'd come out.\n\nIn one group of mice, we vaccinated with 1/20 human dose of FluMist (which has H1N1, nasal route) per mouse; in the other, phosphate-buffered saline. In about 4 weeks, we're also vaccinating with FluZone (which also has H1N1, muscle route). After those treatments, we're going to do a challenge experiment to see if there's any cross strain protection due to the multiple vaccines (live attenuated virus from Mist plus HA antigens from Zone).\n\nThis is a super, super tiny experiment that would have satisfied CFBF's requirements... and it can be completed in 12 weeks.\n\nI'm sure if someone else were interested, they could do neurological studies on the mice, and probably won't find any damage. Although, here's the problem: I think CFBF's requirements are similar to many anti-vaxers... they have their own theories, then want science to spend the money to prove against it. Which, of course, is not how science generally works. We don't try to prove that unicorns don't exist nor do we try to prove that little goblins in the vaccines are causing harm. I believe that there are side-effects of vaccines that were noticed in clinical trials that are printed on the label of the vaccine. But, since it cannot be reproduced reliably and since those side-effects aren't noticed in a large percentage of immunized patients, there isn't a need for a huge study to disprove it (even though scientists have already thoroughly wasted money proving Wakefield's original autism/vaccine study was fraudulent).\n\nThe onus is on the anti-vaxers to find empirical, reproducible proof that their claim is real, not the other way around.	1297353835

It isn't: AlyssaMoore is a propagandist who spends her days posting pseudo-science links, calling people who accept AGW theory (including the majority of people in this subreddit) "True Believers" and likes to indulge in personal attacks against them in the echo chamber known as [/r/climateskeptics](/r/climateskeptics) (especially when they can't answer because they've been banned, as is the case with me).\n\nThere is a high probability she is a paid shill, and is quick to post pre-canned "damage control" responses. She will certainly respond to this with such a copy-pasted response, along the lines of\n\n&gt;You are probably not paid by Greenpeace or the alarmist billionaire George Soros to troll /r/climateskeptics.\n\n&gt;I don't get paid to submit a few articles that are skeptical of the catastrophic man-made global warming theory. I do it because I am skeptical of the claims and predictions of the global warming alarmists.\n\nI like how she continues here propaganda and ad hominem attacks in what first appears to be a reasonable, rational response ("catastrophic man-made global warming", "global warming alarmists", bizarre references to George Soros and Greenpeace).\n\nAsk her to define precisely what "catastrophic" means, however, and you'll get no response. That's because she and the other propagandists in her gang aren't interested in actual science, but only in smearing the reputations of honest scientists and those on reddit who accept the reality of AGW theory.	1333385409
And you just made a horrible analogy, suggesting each choice has equal merit.\n\nA more accurate analogy - you have a toolbox full of tools and you have subjectively chosen a task to complete. Each tool in that toolbox has _objective_ benefits and detriments when it comes to completing that task - a handsaw is going to suck if you're trying to drive nails, and is objectively a poor choice to reach that goal.  Each available tool has a measurable fitness for the job at hand (the handsaw is horrible for nail driving, the sledgehammer better but damn is it unwieldy, and the two pound claw hammer is clearly, objectively, the best); once you have a goal, the rational moralist is choosing moral guidelines based on objective criteria, not subjective, within the context of their over-arching purpose in having a moral code to begin with.\n\n&gt;You are just straight up, totally wrong about this.\n\n*~snort~*\n\n	1341446108

I'd also like to talk about the paranormal in this case because I think what I have to say may be comforting to you. Especially if you're new to the paranormal ideas and beliefs.\n\nYour girlfriend has said that she believes a demon is at work here. It should also be noted that this doesn't sound particularly like most ghost hauntings. The main reason I don't think this could be a ghost is that if she saw a full body apparition, that is extremely rare. It's even more rare for a ghost to take the form of something that would look at all demon like. If anything, it would have looked human or like a mist or shadow. Most ghost hauntings also wouldn't follow her around. Ghosts are generally known for sticking to one location. The fact that she has hard things in her car and in her home seems to be odd for a ghost haunting.\n\nSo that would normally leave us with a demon haunting. But there is a lot here that also points away from it being a demon. A demon would, of course, not be afraid of you. Demons are known for being fairly belligerent and challenges are normally met with increased activity particularly toward the challenge. If this was a demon, you would be very aware of it yourself without your girlfriend needing to share any of her stories. Demon activity would normally be different as well. Whispering names and making people feel uneasy are things that could happen but generally the repertoire of activity is much fuller. Demon hauntings will often result in bloody scratches, physical contact (as in feeling someone grab you *hard* or violently pulling on hair) and they are closely linked with very bad, very strong smells and odors. The fact that your girlfriend has seen something but has not been physically injured or smelled something seems to point more towards her own psyche as being the issue.\n\nIf you're looking into the possibility that her father is causing this activity a lot more research would need to be done. There are only a few religions I know of that combine animal sacrifices with the idea of being able to get demons to do bidings. Most of the well-known religions or cultures that have practiced sacrificial offerings have either died out or changed so much that the idea is more historical than anything else. The closest thing I can think of that would cover something like this would be voodoo/hoodoo or Santeria. But with Santeria, there isn't much that goes into someone talking to demons or satan. Voodoo has a bit more because there are so many gods who do so many things and practitioners are sometimes able to communicate with these gods.\n\nIf she genuinely believes that her father is doing something like practicing voodoo and sending paranormal beings after her. It wouldn't hurt to look into getting something like a gris gris to keep with her. 	1334294743
D8 is water so clean that you can't have it in glas or plastic bottles because it would make the water dirty.

&gt;some Indians even believe it is an ancient Indian "science".

That sounds fascinating, you should do an IAMA one day!\n\nI am astounded by magic, even simple tricks, because of exactly what you describe - the utter conviction in some reptile part of my brain that demands that the rabbit has been conjured out of thin air (while my logical mind screams that there must be *some* reasonable explanation).\n\nI saw a show by a magician the other day (actually a magician who gives wellbeing lectures if you can believe it, using magic as a prop) and it was almost impenetrable to reason at the time. It was so seamlessly done, the reality being presented was absurd (you don't just pull metres of ribbon out of an empty cylinder?) but I could hardly disbelieve it even though I tried.

I've only recently customised my subreddit subscriptions to include this &amp; other subs (I just had the default ones before), so in the past it was either in /r/science or on Facebook, but this thread at least is much different (you all are acting quite civil &amp; nobody's blown up at me).  I'm familiar with "herd immunity", but what are NIH studies? Would you mind giving an example?  I'm actually open to checking out some of the pro-vaccine research, &amp; I've checked out both sides in the past, but the anti-vaccine stuff so far has been a little more specific &amp; informative (e.g. one of the most recent I read: http://www.healthfreedomusa.org/?p=743 ) than the pro-vaccine stuff I've read, which has been more generalisation &amp; speculation (like the posters all over the hospital I used to work at which were all exerpts from the book Vaccine-Preventable Diseases.  I haven't yet read the book but the quotes from it were pretty thin... like the poster about Swine Flu was about "little Billy" who was seriously ill &amp; the doctor wasn't able to determine what was wrong with him, but the father, **not** the doctor mind you, was pretty sure that it was swine flu &amp; that it could have been prevented if he had received the vaccination. BTW, during that swine flu scare, the head doctor at that hospital and his son, and my brother -the only member of my family to get the vaccine-, all got the swine flu right after getting vaccinated for it -nobody else in my family did-).  I really don't go around trying to convince everyone that vaccines are dangerous, but I do share my views with people I'm close with &amp; care about (like family) &amp; that I have the right to decide what goes into my body &amp; whether I trust it or not (as does my family).  Thank you for your polite reply.  I wish I could upvote you more than once.	1317169283
I am not sure about the ekg thing.  perhaps he can actually manipulate his heartrate.  I am not sure why one would not be able to with practice. \n\nAs far as the telekensis, that definitely sounds like your typical fraudulent setup.  They can move very light objects short distances under predetermined circumstances.  (he moved knitting needles balanced on a stand 10 degrees. OMG!  HE IS A WIZARD!

I'm going to post my sighting here if you don't mind, op.\n\n3 weeks ago, I was walking my dog along the beach in the early hours of the morning (about an hour before sunrise).I decided to sit down and chill for awhile. I observed 2 white orbs hover above my head -moving out towards the horizon infront of me (the sea). They were roughly 100ft high, and I distinctly remember seeing one orb swiftly adjust its altitude approximately by 10ft downwards in a  perpendicularly fashion... and I think the other also moved. They were rotating slowly on top of each other (roughly 50ft apart) as they progressed forward out to sea. They probably made one full rotation every 200 metres travelled. The rotation was like a squashed bicycle wheel with the orbs being the reflector lights at 12 &amp; 6 o'click position. I watched until they were no longer visible. My hairs were tingling and standing on end. I stayed until sunrise hoping to see something else, but I did not, nor did I care because I was in awe from that sighting.\n\n	1306201268

Actually, that's not what I argued. I responded to arguments that were defending trolls, saying they prompt valuable self-reflection or stir debate or whatever. None of those benefits require pretentious trolling, so it's an insufficient justification. \n\nI argued that ultimately it's a pathetic ego trip based in some imagined manipulation, but that doesn't preclude that it might be rationalized (privately or explicitly) by some claimed self-righteous intent of exposing others to be foolish or hypocritical or blind to their biases.  	1355762559

&gt;Thank god for someone who actually has some idea what they are talking about.\n\nExcept not?\n\n&gt;Even if he didn't have a sexual motivation, he was still dismissing what she had to say and ignoring her.\n\nNo? You don't know the precise words, or where he was in the vicinity. He may have thought she was just tired of talking to the group. You never know, but you can't make any solid judgments. He even admitted you can't prove sexual motivation.\n\n&gt;Rebecca admonished the guys in the skeptical community not to do that, and a portion of that community blew up, mischaracterized her arguments and put words in her mouth.\n\nNo. PZ Meyers and Phil Plait white knighted and stupid shit was said. This prompted more stupid shit from Watson. Stupid shit storm ensues and the community gets pissed. Elevator coffee request turned into possible sexual assault thanks to Plait. This is what enraged the community.\n\n&gt;So, I'm going to correct the snarky illustration. If I was sitting in a hotel bar with a group of people and I told the group I didn't have any cash so I was going up to my room to get it, and then someone (doesn't matter what race or physical build, either) who was in that group but I hadn't talked to got up, followed me into the elevator, and asked me if I had change for a $20, yes I think I would rightly feel a little freaked out and it wouldn't be unreasonable for me to request that people not do that.\n\nBeing awake isn't a commodity you carry on your person. Minds can be changed and bodies can lie about need of sleep. Coffee, as it turns out, can help change your tiredness a bit. It would be more like asking them if they wanted to come to your room because you have a few quarters. But it's not like that, either, really. The analogy is preposterously inapt and shows how, on a very basic level, the person you replied to failed to understand the situation.	1310756618

Two guys I recommend reading on this subject are Gary Taubes (*Good Calories, Bad Calories*, goes into the most detail) and Robert Lustig.  I can't speak for the specifics of the 60 Minutes piece but regarding the overall hypothesis, these two guys make a compelling case that sugar is a chronic toxin.\n\nJust saying "sugar" is of course imprecise and unhelpful.  Lustig is primarily concerned with fructose.  Glucose by itself is fine, he says.  Taubes's hypothesis is about the effects of all carbohydrate and what happens when we chronically eat too much of it.  	1333724700
That JFK was murdered as part of a conspiracy.   Still not likely in my opinion, but it doesn't need magic, a god-person, Bigfoot, special mind powers, or space aliens for it to be true.   Just a bunch of people that really could keep a secret.  And though unlikely, since it doesn't involve anything new in science or world-view, I think it would be the most likely to be true.  \n\nNow, if you ask me which of the various JFK conspiracies that would be.... well, I don't know.   	1278973406
Some humans are very suggestible, I suspect that this explains most hypnotism. It seems to also be usable as a very powerful placebo, I read about one hypnotist awhile ago who apparently used self-hypnosis before having surgery on his hand which was done without anaesthetic, he apparently didn't find it painful. I'm willing to believe that, pain is something that can be significantly reduced with placebos.\n\n*Addendum*\n\nStory about man hypnotising himself before surgery. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/sussex/7355523.stm\n\nAlso a discussion about the story on the randi.org forums. http://forums.randi.org/archive/index.php/t-111742.html	1307287332
first of all, your evidence is entirely anecdotal, so let me counter it with my anecdote: I know many vegetarians (not vegans) and none of them have significant health problems. None have ever had to go to the hospital or have even gotten sick, as far as I know, because of their diet. \n\nSecondly, strict veganism or vegetarianism is not more 'natural' than eating meat, but who cares? I don't base my diet decisions on what our ancestors might have eaten or what we are 'meant' to eat any more than I base any other ethical decisions on the behavior of apes. That being said, a diet without meat might be closer to our 'natural' diet than the huge quantities of meat that we eat in the west. \n\nAlso, as a side note, if you are a vegetarian and are having trouble getting iron, you are doing it wrong. Eat some lettuce, dude.	1297868364

My thinking is that if I don’t capture it on my equipment I am going to doubt that it is legitimate. Like the pictures I posted. I know the person and what their capability is and I doubt she could fake them however they look too good to be true. Even with my equipment when I hear EVPs I scrutinize them for any other possible source of background noise first. We also copy all evidence from an investigation and then have three people separately check it and see if they get the same results. Unfortunately with modern technology when viewing paranormal evidence you have to trust the source or take it as a possible fake.	1336488574

Haven't done much in the way of chemical hallucinogens, but I have cultivated the ability to self induce states of hypnagogia/lucid dreaming/out of body experiences. Many of these dreams feel very much like hallucinations, including such things as interacting with people I know who are sitting on the foot of my bed (though they are not really there). Other times I have the experience of walking around my room outside of my body, sometimes having trouble "getting back into it."\n\nThis has gone a long way toward informing my skepticism as I can sincerely say I believe I have had the "experience" of out of body AND I cannot rule out that it is just a mental hallucination of sorts (hypnagogia). It has also given me the chance to experiment with extended knowledge by having people hide stuff in a specific place.\n\nObviously this is all just as anecdotal as the person who believes they've really had an out of body experience, but it does give me a different perspective and I can see how easy it is to believe in such things without a very solid mode of critical thinking.	1325608269

Ive cooled down a bit. Boy that vent did feel good though. For the record the camera that shot the movies were unique. This created a problem as there was no technology at the time to just convert and play over television and the players were so proprietary that the films could only be watched on them. The broadcast footage is done by taking a TV camera and pointing it at the screen/monitor of the footage being played. Thus the horrid quality. The footage is still archived. I heard on NPR that a player was tracked down and footage has been being converted. I think that's what's been seen in some of the latest documentaries. 	1319837016

&gt; A few people with unlimited budgetary resources funded international agents (muslim and others)\n\nHow many is "a few"? Because even with your estimate, it's still at least the people who hijacked the planes, plus a demolition team to somehow plant charges which remained unnoticed not only in the hours leading up to the plane crash but in the collapse itself, plus whoever was digging through the rubble -- they didn't find enough of the kind of residue expected to suggest anything overly suspicious...\n\nPlus the intelligence we had that Al-Qaeda was planning just such an event? Plus whoever authorized the "unlimited funding"?\n\nAnd not *one* of these people involved in this conspiracy ever had a crisis of conscience and came forward, or even dumped evidence of it onto Wikileaks?\n\nEven if it's as small as you're playing, this seems similar to Feynman's response to UFOs -- that they are much more likely the product of known properties of terrestrial intelligence than of unknown properties of extraterrestrial intelligence. It seems clear that 9/11 is much more likely the product of the known hatred and determination of extremist Islamic terrorism than some unknown element of domestic government-sponsored terrorism.\n\nThis is still giving more credit than is due to the "controlled demolition" idea.

It's most likely that there's simply a naturally occurring high level of fluoride in the local water supply.\n\nThe thing that bakes my noodle about this is that people are saying that fluroide shouldn't be put in water supplies becuase of this study, but the levels of exposure in this were up to 450% higher than the MAXIMUM recommended safe levels.\n\nIt's basically people running around yelling FLUORIDE ISN'T SAFE AT ANY LEVEL CAUSE IF YOU HAVE TOO MUCH OF IT IT KILLS YOU...

Orthopedic surgeons evaluate people with scoliosis. If it is a child, the surgeon may recommend bracing and potentially surgery based on severity, type, and remaining growth. If it is adult degenerative scoliosis, then surgery can be considered for pain relief as a last resort. If there are progressive neurological deficits, you will likely need surgery. \n\nSo, there are different types and severities of scoliosis.\n\nPrimary care providers screen kids for scoliosis. For adults who want to treat their back pain and try to avoid surgery, they can go to their primary care physician,  pain specialists (usually anesthesiologists with specialized training), physiatrists ( also called physical medicine and rehabilitation), and physical therapists. If they want to explore the world of alternative medicine, they can see chiropractors, acupuncturists, etc. \n\nThere is danger in allowing a chiropractor to treat pediatric scoliosis instead of an orthopedist. The child may miss the opportunity for effective treatment (including operative and non-operative) while the growth plates are open. I suspect that the most reasonable chiropractors will refer these kids to their local pediatric orthopedic surgeon. \n\nI'm not so bothered if a chiropractor treats adult scoliosis. And I don't have any citations for you, I don't care if you take your adult back to a chiropractor. I don't doubt that you might even find some benefit. But do not compromise the health of children by advocating for chiropractic and other alternative treatments to the exclusion of evidence based medicine. \n\n	1337669371

We really are going to have to continue this IRL, cause I'm giving up the internet for awhile starting tomorrow, but first a few rebuttals:\n\nMy argument isn't "morphing"; I am pointing out that YOUR frequent statement that acupuncture doesn't work beyond placebo is both factually untrue and **by your own admission** based on assumptions you have made, mostly because a bunch of authorities have said so.\n\nBut you think I'm the unscientific one?\n\nI don't have much interest in reading a few hundred Cochrane Reviews because; as I have said to you many times, I do not think that acupuncture can be adequately 'placebo'd' for testing.  I don't think the Reviews have much to say about actual practice.  \n\nAcupuncture isn't a pill that could be dispensed by anyone.  It's more akin to massage or even surgery; the skill of the practitioner matters.  I suspect a lot of acupuncture trials are essentially testing crappy acupuncture against other crappy acupuncture - not very informative.  \n\n[This](http://www.naturalnews.com/025057_acupuncture_placebo_brain.html) is a story about a study (that I can't find a direct link to at the moment) that used fMRI to show changes in the brains of patients receiving 'verum' acupuncture.  It had a positive result but I point it out for the mention in the second paragraph that the test subjects were all "naive to acupuncture".  Think about that for a moment.  What would you think of a pharmaceutical study that used a placebo that only worked as a placebo if the subjects had never taken pills before? \n\n&gt;The underlying basis for acupuncture (qi flowing through meridians in the body) is completely unsupported by available evidence. I assume this is the "magic and gibberish" basis for TCM referenced in the original article. This means acupuncture has poor prior plausibility; before ever testing a thing, there is little reason to think acupuncture should work.\n\nAnd here's the crux of the issue.  You assume that all studies confirm your bias here.  You have a very poor understanding of TCM in general and Qi specifically and from this you conclude that there is little reason to think it might work.  I suspect your assumptions are shared by many of the folks conducting research into acupuncture; how do you think that might effect the studies they perform, and the peer reviews to which those studies are subjected?\n\nQi is not a magical property.  It is a concept that is very difficult to translate adequately, because it means different things in different contexts.  This vagueness is common in Chinese languages I'm told, but very uncomfortable for English speakers to wrap our heads around.  Qi originally means 'breath'. In other cases in would best be translated as nutrition.  Are those magical concepts? Or do you agree that they are tangible, measurable, requirements for human health?  In the case of acupuncture I think 'de qi' is best translated as [introception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoception).  Does that help?\n\nAs for the assuming it shouldn't work; who would believe that moldy bread could cure infections?  On the face of it that's absurd too.  \n\n&gt;TCM practitioners may not just prescribe untested treatments; they continue to prescribe treatments that HAVE been tested and found to be ineffective or harmful.\n\nAgain you provide NO citations. \n\nI don't argue that TCM herbal formulae aren't potentially dangerous; I know they are.  Just as pharmaceuticals can be dangerous.  They have to be appropriately prescribed by well trained practitioners.   \n\nAgain I think you are making huge assumptions based on your biases.   Chinese herbal medicine has been tested and continues to be tested (often in languages you and I do not speak, so it's hard to point to studies).  \n\n&gt;I assume this is the "magic and gibberish" basis for TCM referenced in the original article.\n\nHere is an example. The original article (I suggest you read it) was essentially a response to a tragic story of a mama bear killing her cub and herself; they were being held in horrific conditions so that their bile could be harvested.  Of course I do not condone this practice , neither does any other TCM practitioner I know.  But **nothing** in the article was scientific evidence that Xiong Dan (bear bile) doesn't work to relieve febrile seizures.  That's what it's claimed to do.  I don't think we'll ever see a study, nor should we, too unethical.  But dismissing all of TCM as superstitious nonsense because of this abhorrent practice isn't science or scepticism.  (Not to mention that here in North America we subject animals to equally horrific conditions so that we can have cheap bacon.)\n\nPlease don't respond here - I won't get to see it - come for a coffee and we'll continue the conversation.	1314797903

A few years ago one of my best friends in the world (Canadian) was in Thailand working on his PHD shortly before he left his mother died. While there he had to take a cab to go to the airport, on the way the driver suggested they stop at a historical area (I'm not certain where) my friend agreed and spent some time(free of taxi charges) walking through these botanical gardens. Eventually he made it back to the cab only to be asked by the cabbie who the woman was that was walking with him? Confused, my friend asked what woman was he talking about? The cabbie then in amazing detail described his recently deceased mother. The thing that freaks me out most about this story is my friend is a hardcore atheist, but even he was taken aback by the way the  cabbie just thought he was walking through the gardens with another western person. Creepy but very soothing at the same time	1337825368

Yes, of course it's popular because it's cheap. But as far as I know most aid organizations call this dumping and warn against it, because it undermines local industry. It's not that these organizations don't want people to have affordable clothing, but they recognize the importance of a viable industry to lift the whole country out of poverty. \n\nI guess it's kind of like Walmart: very popular among the locals because it's cheap (we can't afford to not buy there), but when all the small local businesses go bankrupt, then the locals still suffer.\n\nI have no idea for what to do with this problem, though. We rich people buy and throw away such gigantic amounts of clothes every year, so some sort of reusing/recycling must be done with them. And it's a shame to not let people who need clothes get perfectly fine clothes that we throw away.\n\nI guess I would prefer to give away clothes to poor people in the rich countries (we don't have any clothing industry that needs support anyway), then sell clothes in used clothing stores here, and then perhaps do as Salvation. Army and make blankets out of the worst and give them to kids on the streets of cold countries (that's what I've heard they do at least)\n\nHere in Norway the Tvind clothing business goes under the name UFF (Umana Folk til Folk) or Humana People to People. I had never heard of their schools until one of their recruiters stopped me on the street and gave me some paper about it. I was quite shocked to find out about their shady business as they have a lot of shops here, and many parts of Norway have an equal deal with them and Salvation Army for putting up those donation boxes (they get 50% of the available space for those boxes each).	1344330902
I didn't say anything about common metals. I said the people who describe them describe them as metallic, which they demonstrably do. Then i posed the question; does it not seem strange that a race capable of unimaginable feats of transportation use a material as primitive as metal when they would undoubtable have access to far superior composite materials.\n\nIt was at this point that people run around in circles not knowing whether to argue that they would use metal or that they have used a composite material, just one that exactly resembles metal. basically they had a hard time forming anything but a contrived rationalisation that gave them an excuse not to think about it. It was the kind of response we would expect from the religious, not a group intent on forming rational conclusions.	1334169460

The tone of many comments on this thread show how true this is, the theme of many is that Drew and folks like Gitlow can't be legitimate doctors who draw different conclusions from evidence, they have to be corrupt quacks since they divert from pro-cannabis orthodoxy. 	1344979929

I've been doing research lately, and from what I've collected is when they communicate with you, it comes as an idea that you 'thought' of yourself. I haven't looked into the aircraft concept you're talking about, sorry if what I say is irrelevant. :(\n\nBut something I'll put out there is they have (if it's all real) been helping us slowly reach awareness, each one of us. Over the course of the past year, they have been sending energies to this planet to make people ask questions they never have before; they provide the answers in time, but it comes from within you, through your own ideas from the energy they are sending. \n\nUFOs have been more frequent because they are raising awareness about their existence while providing energies to guide. Usually it is over more populated areas because they can reach more people at once. \n\nOkie dokie- I am only saying this because if it were real, it would resonate within people that are 'awake'. My brain tells me it is fake, but something else is telling me it's real so I am very conflicted, idk how I feel about it. I have had many strange unexplainable things happen to me lately and it has lead me to where I am now. Before the beginning of this year I never thought about ETs as much as I have now.

The butter would block these, as butter is hydrophobic, and may even cause an increased rate of cavity growth.\n\nThough, if enough butter got into the cavity, likely the pain would decrease, because the dentin wouldn't be exposed to air. Wouldn't mean that the cavity is gone, just that it's... not painful anymore. Not painful, and probably growing at an increased rate.	1351480535

People are mad, because you should realize that and not force them to deal with it, even if it is legal.\n\nedit: Cue downvotes from butthurt cyclists.	1348759594
Almost right.  They don't have to accept any applicant that is an arbitrary claim.  They don't have the right to arbitrarily reject an applicant.  \n\nI think a case could be made for the placebo effect, both that it fits as a 'mental or psychic ability' and that it is scientifically verifiable if not scientifically explainable.\n\nIt's an idea I've played with, both privately and in forums discussing Randi, in the past.  So far, the reactions break down into knee-jerk denials, denials based on false associations (see the homeopathic blind alley in this thread as an example), denials based on tail-swallowing rhetoric (see the argument that holds that because the placebo effect is a known phenomenon, though unexplained, it therefore can't be considered because, well, it's known, also in this thread) and very, very little skeptical (from the point of view of actually possibly meeting the challenge) consideration.	1304189875

I mean, we're making an educated guess here. If Source A is right 99% of the time, and has been for 20 years, then an article picked at random is 99% likely to be accurate. On the other hand, if Source B has been historically accurate just 30% of the time, then we would expect an article picked at random be be inaccurate with a 70% likelihood. Not all sources are equal.	1310623408

What do I think, personally? Well, I'm a libertarian that agrees with public choice theory, but I'm trying to cover all angles and keep the discussion less centered around my personal views and more centered around evidence, since this is /r/skeptic and not /r/politics or /r/libertarian.	1339723216

Yeah, Drudge isn't dishonest in his choice of sources, generally (aside from being a fan of a few sites like Breitbart); he's dishonest in his *juxtaposition* of headlines.

The numbers are astonishing... there was an article about it somewhere. I was considering factoring image quality (in pixels) into the equation to make the situation even worse for UFO aficionados. I don't remember the stats, but it's something like... there were more photos taken in 2012 than from 1800 - 1990. And the photos were of higher quality, in many instances they were hundreds of times more detailed. The common thread to almost all UFO photos is that the object in question is just beyond the limits of resolution.	1356834207
Well, there's the crazy paranormal and then the more normal paranormal explanation. Humans used to be alot crazier in the older days and people would do weird things just like animals in a natural disaster or bad happening in general. Each person is different. Those who feel fatigue when a friend or relative is dying is feeling empathatic. You though, in my unprofessional but studied opinion used your survival senses and saved your ass as well as your grandmother's. Your spidey senses tingled and you took action....sorta....you can trace these weird phenomena throughout our history. We've lost alot of our ability to be replaced by what we use today mentally. We aremt hunters or figjters anymore but have retained a sense of our badassery.	1351180963

I wouldn't say it's a about being devout. There's no skeptic God to appease. It's that you hear a lot of anti-vax bullshit, and some of us are very severe about fighting it.\n\nI think the root of the problem is that it seems like your protests are too great to be just skeptical, and you're approaching a fanaticism about it. Yes, the CDC thinks vaccines are good, but could do without mercury. I don't think anyone would complain about having less heavy metals in shit we inject into children. However, they've been used for a long, long time and their efficacy is proven. Harm isn't proven, and it doesn't seem to be indicated. At least, not any more than harm than a rash.\n\nNobody was saying that vaccines shouldn't be researched more, but just that if you think they're dangerous you need some citations for it other than a bit of redness and a non-binding desire of the CDC to see mercury no longer used.	1311014443

It's certainly better than the average diet of those in the western world, but, I can't agree with the premises that it is built upon. There was no single diet humans lived by in the hunter gatherer period of our history, we spread all over the world and lived on a wide variety of of different foods. And generally, we starved most of the time and overate when we had the chance.\n\nThe whole fad diet thing in general is kinda silly, we know how to lose weight already.

I understand that the genetic variance within any one group of humans is going to be larger than the genetic variations between groups. But there will be genetic differences which are common to say a Han Chinese person and a Caucasian person, and it's not just skin and hair colour, most Chinese people (from my own observation) have a lower nose bridge than most Europeans do, so there is also tiny skeletal differences there.\n\nThe thing that got me started thinking about this was this [BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9369000/9369238.stm) about a new subspecies of leopard. The specific details are pretty sparse, but it got me wondering if the genetic differences between that leopard and the other one on the mainland were actually any larger than the differences between what is often called race when talking about human differences.	1298535334

I guess you need to define what you are looking to legitimize,...aliens craft? black budget craft? natural unknown aerial phenomenon?,...and what your standards are, as obviously there is ZERO legitimate physical evidence that everyone in the world says-Yes thats scientifically proven alien intervention/artifact/footage,...thats what defines them as Unidentified,...\n\n\nI find the most compelling evidence multiple witness testimony with secondary tracking(vid/photo/radar). This sort of triangulates the evidence of the sighting and really makes a sighting hard if not impossible to dismiss, although perhaps not conclusive (ergo the unidentified/unknown still).\n\n\nI also lament the numerous BS youtube links of lanterns LED kites, etc. that get thrown into the mix- as it seems to be occurring more and more on this sub, and maybe its just a result of more and more BS being thrown on YT from cellphones and CGI software suites,...either way I usually just skip over them in favor of blogs or **real** info.\n\n\ndopp3lganger gave you some great cases to dig into but if you really want to get deeper into the subject try some books or interviews from some researchers as they have already committed the time(hopefully) to vett their sources and do the legwork of investigation. \n\nLeslie Keen, Richard Dolan, Jaques Vallee, never disappoint,...\n\n\n[Documentaries](http://documentaryheaven.com/?s=ufo&amp;x=0&amp;y=0)\n\n\n[BinallOfAmerica](http://binnallofamerica.com/audio5.html) and the [Paracast](http://www.theparacast.com/) are two of my fav podcasts,...\n\n\nI think you want a smoking gun that probably doesnt exist, but imo the number of still legit unknowns and continued govt resistance on the secrecy they maintain around the subject is proof enough that something(and probably many various somethings) are frequenting the skies of our little blue marble,...	1304446866

Actually this is a common misconception. Diabetics (both types) are unable to process sugar properly but eating excess sugar is not the cause of diabetes in itself. \n\nType II diabetes is caused by obesity - so you can increase your risk of type II diabetes by eating more _anything_. (Type I diabetes is actually a completely different disease: it's partially genetic and partially an unknown trigger but there's quite a bit of debate about what the environmental factors are). You could technically become obese and trigger diabetes without eating any extra sugar.\n\nThe fact that type II diabetics tend to be obese people who tend to enjoy eating a lot of sugar is just because eating a lot of sugar is correlated with being obese but it's not the primary cause of diabetes.	1305141453

Less condescending hyperbole and framing might help. In fact, I am very much reminded of Mooney's replies to Myers et all when reading your post.\n\nMany, many people in the medical and skeptical blogosphere would completely disagree with your assertion that the current confrontational approach isn't working. The past year has seen increasingly skeptical and factually accurate coverage of the anti-vaccine lunatics in the mainstream media - and in many cases this has directly lead on from the "strident" bloggers who are leading the fight. The anti-vaccine movement, like the creationists and the other anti-intellectuals, have highly emotive and superficially convincing arguments at their disposal, and they aren't affraid to blatantly lie and deceive to achieve their ends. We are fighting over the middle ground of concerned parents that genuinely want the right information. Unfortunately, stories are obviously more convincing than facts - and a conciliatory approach just won't work for everyone.\n\nNo one is arguing that a plurality of responses is required - different messages will reach different people. The problem with Mooney is that he thinks everyone that disagrees with him should shut up. 	1265520583

The question I think is if we're talking politically specifically or in general. I would agree it's probably true that a conservative gambler would have a "larger fear center" (also a little too ambiguous for my tastes), as the reason they would be content with walking away with only a small profit is because they're afraid to lose it all.\n\nBut when you talk about a "conservative" and a "liberal" in political terms the lines are so blurred that any such generalization is moot.	1294044087

If she's functional and seems all right other than "seeing" spirits, she's probably not schizophrenic.

If the spacecraft creates a "gravity bubble" around it by using advanced technology to warp the space around it (essentially "pulling" the ship forward, instead of pushing it) it may need to change shape to remain stable when encountering different levels of gravity. Traveling at high speeds in interstellar space (where there is no gravity) would be very different from hovering motionless above the surface of a planet such as Earth, and a ship may need to compensate for fluctuations in gravity in order to remain stable at low speeds. This might be accomplished by changing it's shape (and the shape of the bubble). I wondered about this as a kid, after watching the transformation of the ship in "Flight of the Navigator". I know it's just a movie... but it made me think about it. :D	1307861437

These are MacDougall's lab notes from one of the sessions of the experiment:\n "The patient . . . lost weight slowly at the rate of one ounce per hour due to evaporation of moisture in respiration and evaporation of sweat. During all three hours and forty minutes I kept the beam end slightly above balance near the upper limiting bar in order to make the test more decisive if it should come. At the end of three hours and forty minutes he expired and suddenly, coincident with death, the beam end dropped with an audible stroke hitting against the lower limiting bar and remaining there with no rebound. The loss was ascertained to be three-fourths of an ounce."\n\nApparently MacDougall took these measurements after accounting for weight loss attributed to moisture &amp; air leaving the body. After averaging the amounts in the drop of weight in 5 other dead patients (besides the one described above) he discovered an uncounted loss of 21 grams, which he equated with the weight of the soul.\n\nThe dog experiment that he did was to test whether or not animals experienced this drop in weight, &amp; would thereby have a soul. He weighed 15 dogs &amp; discovered no weight loss, thus confirming his religious convictions that only humans have souls. \n\nThese experiments where discredited however in 1907, after his results were published in The New York Times, by the physician Augustus P. Clarke. Clarke noted that at the time of death there was a sudden rise in body temperature which was due to the fact that the lungs had stopped working &amp; thus stopped cooling the blood. The subsequent rise in sweating easily accounted for MacDougall's weight of the soul. This also explains why the weight loss wasn't found in the 15 dogs, considering canines only have sweat glands on their tongues. \nHence the lack of scientific credulity.	1355328514

With difficulty in some cases. Generally, a double blind study. Take acupunctre, test the "proper" thing against placing the needles at random. If both work equally well, you can dismiss most of the claim about acupuncture right there leaving only the "stabbing people with thin needles helps pain somehow". Next up, you can try to demonstrate a physiological phenomenon, that is test to see if there is a direct physical effect from the needles on some objective measure. Harder, but doable. If there is no physical phenomenon then it's a psychological one.\n\nAs far as acupuncture goes, the first has been done ad nauseum. Result; no difference between "masters" doing it properly and random people doing it randomly. The second is much harder, but it seems like there is little to no demonstrable physical effect with acupuncture.	1345640758

&gt;It's not the placebo effect, it's confirmation bias.\n\nIt can be, but of course animals (and presumably babies) do experience the placebo effect through classical conditioning, and not just apparent benefits recorded by unblinded observers.\n\nFor example, we know that substances with no active component (i.e. placebos) can suppress the immune function of rats, as discussed in the article I linked to above:\n\n&gt;One of the most dramatic demonstrations of a placebo effect in\nnonhuman animals involved conditioned immunosuppression in\nrats. Ader and Cohen (1975) paired a novel saccharine-flavored\nliquid with the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide. After a\nnumber of pairings, the saccharine solution administered alone\nbrought about a decreased immune response in the rats (Ader &amp;\nCohen, 1975). The saccharin solution had become a CS (placebo),\ncapable of eliciting immunosuppression (the placebo effect).\nAder’s groundbreaking experiments caused a stir, for it was generally held at the time that conditioning procedures could not\ninfluence the immune system (see Harrington, 1997). Many of\nAder’s results mesh well with the regularities uncovered in classical conditioning research. First, as would be predicted from the\ngeneral finding that a stronger US produces a stronger CR, rats\ngiven two doses of cyclophosphamide during the conditioning\nstage later exhibited greater conditioned immunosuppression than\nthose given only one dose. Second, the extent of immunosuppression depended on the schedule of reinforcement. Third, in the\nabsence of CS–US pairings, the conditioned immunosuppression\ntypically extinguished (Ader, 1985). The finding that immunosuppression can be conditioned has been well replicated (Ader &amp;\nCohen, 1982, 1991; Ghanta, Hiramoto, Solvason, &amp; Spector, 1987;\nKrank &amp; MacQueen, 1988; McCoy, Roszman, Miller, Keely, &amp;\nTitus, 1986).\n\nThe 'expectation' (i.e. conditioning) of an animal can result in effects which are entirely unrelated to the inactive substance they are given. \n\nBut I agree that confirmation bias does play a role in a lot of the "studies" on this topic, particularly by homeopaths and co who try to demonstrate that their product must work because the placebo effect "does not occur in animals". So, as you point out, the owners of the animal who are expecting to see an improvement, will see one because of their confirmation bias. 	1324003483
Purely a placebo effect on subjective symptoms.\n\nThere are ample studies showing that sticking needles in you provokes physiological responses but that is irrelevant to the claims made.	1335108887

The oxygen breaks away from the H2O2 into a free radical O-, which is then what actually removes stains that are positively charged. I guess it is possible that the oxygen bubbling into the water may cause the creation of some H2O2, but this would be a different mechanism than the one proposed in the literature. 	1342559281

As someone who's worked with audio processing, I could tell immediately this "sound" was synthesized. The "echoing" effect does not match the environment the video was shot in (it sounds a like a metal table being dragged across a concrete floor put through a "big warehouse" or "large hall" reverb preset you find in virtually any audio editor.)\nAlso the frequency range of the video's audio was of a lower quality than the "sound."

This is a very interesting phenomenon, whatever its identity. I'm fully in agreement with those who state that the brain does remarkable things with sensory input on a constant basis, but I also believe that there is more to the universe than what we are able to sense directly through the "five senses." \n\nI am curious as to how the Khai'min communicated their name to your friend; was it spoken, or written down for him/her, in the dream, or was it simply, inherently "known" by your friend upon awakening?\n\nI find it interesting that people tend to ascribe "shadow people" to being whatever most suits their paranormal curiosities; I've heard them referred to as being ghosts, demons, guardian angels, and aliens. Historically, throughout history and in a variety of cultures, creatures such as vampires and ancestral spirits were said to visit their descendants (or victims, in some cases) as "shadowy figures." Many, many people have clearly had the same experience and, just as clearly, have interpreted it in accordance with their pre-existing beliefs and fascinations.\n\nMe, I find everything fascinating, and I've no idea what they are, though I do enjoy theorizing about it. \n\nI've never heard stories of shadow-people accompanied by any sort of vocalization, before, although I have heard stories about their being accompanied by other sensory phenomena: for example, one friend of mine has stated that, whenever she sees one of these shadows out of the corner of her eye, the wall or other surface on which it appears is red-tinted (her belief: demons, or whatever lies at the root of the origin of demon-belief, rather). A student I spoke with stated that he sometimes feels a chill in the air when he encounters shadow-people, and added that he usually runs into them in a particular portion of an old house that belongs to his family. Sometimes, he gets the feeling that there is 'something' that is somehow 'behind' the chill in the air, for want of a better description. He seems to believe that he is having an encounter with ghosts or spirits of some kind.	1339646500

Let me try this again:\n\nOne case study = one data point ≠ concrete evidence\n\nThe only way to disprove the null hypothesis (which in this case would be: accupuncture has no therapeutic effect above the level of placebo) is to have blinded sets of test and control subjects in a number sufficient to give a good predictive power to the outcome. Then, if final data shows a significant (95% confidence) difference between control and test subjects, that is taken as evidence for efficacy of the treatment. Anything short of that can be ascribed to various reasons such as chance occurrence, technical/statistical/experimenter error or placebo effect. \n\nReport of a single case is interesting. It may provoke more inquiry into the validity of a modality, but is not sufficient to validate the treatment by itself.\n\nThis is how the scientific method works. This is why it takes us years to  publish a study and to finally put it to use in the clinic. Anything that does not undergo such rigorous vetting process cannot be relied upon.	1335207365

Let's ignore for the moment that the site doesn't give links to the study, and point out how you misinterpreted what it say.\n\nFirst, it says that surface water has gotten .59°C hotter. The multi-depth average was .33°C, which is where I assume you got your number.\n\nThis is definitely not a measure of overall global temperature, as water, especially water below the surface, takes much more energy to heat than the air. You global warming "skeptics" are largely all the same, misinterpreting information and claiming you're skeptical even though you just lack reading comprehension. That's not skepticism, there is verified, tested scientific data that shows that it's real.\n\nEdit: Noticed I incorrectly stated it was .59°C at 366 meters, this was due to rewriting my initial response and forgetting to change things around. It's .39°C at 366 meters depth.	1333468696

Ok. Well, same impasse as before. \n\nIronically, willingness to believe in aliens affects the perception of UFO's transparently enough in this sub. You'll find that people unwilling to believe in aliens say that most UFO's are chinese lanterns, photoshop, flares, etc. And people who already believe in aliens believe a much larger percentage of UFO's are intelligently piloted. \n\nBut willingness to believe in a God that *does* exist is not seen as a precursor to the perception of that God. Or a prerequisite, if you will.\n\nFichte, et. al. rebelled against organized religion in much the same way as in the modern era. But they declined to close their minds in any way.  They wanted to be without bias.  And they came to a perception of reality that included God as a philosophical entity.\n\nTL;DR: Willingness is everything, in UFO's, aliens ... everything.

I work in the dairy food industry (not milk but ice cream, yogurt and so on) and we test for antibiotics to the parts-per-billion level. Antibiotic detection would lead to rejection of the delivery, or product recall if it somehow found its way into final product. Having said that, on-farm programs are stringent for screening out antibiotics - farmers lose their right to deliver if they have more than one detection. This is in Australia so YMMV.\n\nIn 25 years in the industry I'm not aware of a confirmed antibiotic detection in any milk coming from farms to our factories. We've had several near-misses where minute amounts of sanitiser has been found in raw milk, which (back in the old days) used to trigger on our antibiotic test but follow-up testing differentiated between the sanitiser and antibiotic. Obviously we still rejected the deliveries. Nowadays the test we use is specific to antibiotics.	1346827240

Reports of UFO's have been around since LONG before Chris Carter (creator of X-Files) was even born. And even before we had planes. I don't know why exactly the UFO's are interested in the US, you are right, there are more REPORTED sightings here. There are woodcuts from Nuremberg, Germany depicting battles in the sky between flying things from 1561.  Also, I would say that more people probably believe in ET's and UFO's in this day because of the sheer improvement in knowledge. We know that we're made of stardust, we know that the universe is incredibly old, we know that the building blocks of life are scattered throughout the universe. We know now about Panspermia. The chances of us being alone are nil. It's either us or there is a lot of life universally. So, if you start there, universe being old and filled with building blocks of life. Then you add in that we humans are barely a Type 1 civilization, and if you can imagine there may be Type 2 or even 3 civilizations, then it becomes harder to conceive that they wouldn't have technology to bend/fold/manipulate time and space.\n\nSo much to think about. But truthfully, the best thing I can tell you to do is look up. If you have access to GOOD Night Vision Binoculars, that will help too, as many of these crafts are only visible outside of our visual spectrum. Which could mean they are inter-dimensional or from another universe(maybe). It's just, honestly, super unlikely that we are alone. I think, you should start there. Contemplate: Could it just be us? Could this vast universe filled with the building blocks of life only have harbored life on Earth? I think if you consider it in those terms you will find that the odds are quite small we could be alone. Of course, if you are looking for a dead body and DNA, I am unable to produce that. \n\nAlso, I don't know if the government is maliciously hiding information on this subject. I mean, I don't have special insider knowledge. BUT, I will say this: Our government HAS reported UFO's over nuke sites, these craft seemingly disabled (individually and remotely) their equipment. Also, you should look into the Rendlesham Forest Incident. Lots of military personnel reported seeing something strange over a few nights there, too. You can view the documents thru the FOIA. These are well-documented cases, too. The Mexican military also has RELEASED information and video concerning unknown flying objects over their skies as well. You can see this as easily as going to Youtube.	1345395934

Here's my simple argument for science. \n\nBible - treated as fact with no actual evidence or real peer review all based on faith\n\nScience - treated as a series of hypothetical/theoretical questions that we rechallenge everyday by a worldwide network the smartest people on the planet.\n\nScience also admits that is is wrong all the time when new evidence is discovered.\n\nThe bible is a collection of stories that was written basically 2000years ago by a few people with a possible agenda. (Look at leviticus, its just a list of rules) It was also written in a now dead language which was translated incorrectly in several parts. Then several books were interchanged/dropped/added throughout the bible by King James. Yet this shell of its former self is still taken as fact.\n\nScience documents go through years of study and peer review by a collection (there are a lot of scientists) of (arguably) the highest educated people across the globe. These scientist come from everywhere and therefore have different religions, cultures, beliefs. Yet they ALL want to kill YOUR god. - guess that explains all the christian scientists\n\nTL:DR science&gt;bible because it has peer review and changes its stance as new evidence emerges	1347294102
so nothing changed and you're still interested?	1320150738

I've followed the "debate" and studied the subject at great length for years now. It's extremely important to separate idealism from reality when wanting to do something positive towards disclosure.\n\nTo think that telling Obama to disclose such information will be in any way effective is to completely disregard the fact that **he is not privvy to such information**. The group that oversees such policy is extragovernmental and international, and has been in place for over 50 years now.\n\nIf you want to argue for something effective towards disclosure, try arguing that anyone involved in keeping this institutionalized secret deserves full immunity from prosecution. That is what this is really about: people covering their asses.	1232061432

I don't think there's any motive the US could have had, in 2001, to kill it's citizens; but in any case that's not the point of asking the question.\n\nI think we can agree that if the gov did kill its own citizens, it would need a *hell* of a good reason; thus the burden of proof for the gov's motive is *much stronger* than the burden of proof that 9/11 was an inside job. But this isn't how truthers think. Rather they see evidence that the 9/11 official report was false, and start looking for reasons the US might have perpetrated the incident. A skeptic (i.e. a rational arguer) would insist that such a motive be present before considering the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job; there are, after all, many ways we could explain the dubiousness of the official 9/11 report. \n\nThis is why you ask this question to someone who has only recently stumbled across 9/11 truthism. If they attempt to come up with a motive on the spot, rather than having thought about it in some detail, it tells you they are less likely to accept logical arguments against their belief. (It doesn't necessarily tell you whether the US gov could have had a motive for 9/11 - that requires an argument one way or the other.)\n\nEDIT: I should add that the same reasoning applies to the question of "Do you really think the gov could organize itself to cover it up?" Again, the answer to this requires stronger proof than that the official report was false.	1315763635

If ghosts existed, the military would be on that, ghosts would make great spies. Credit card companies don't hire anti-psychics to protect their data. If I saw something personally, the first thing I should think is to get myself checked for hallucinations, or think of a way I could measure it or show others. If anything paranormal did exist it would be painfully obvious, unless one wants to invoke a conspiracy theory that the government is keeping it all secret so the lack of evidence is all the evidence he needs.	1322172800

I pmed Dancingwiththestars with this (I left /r/athiesm and stopped following the subreddits a while back for the same bs but was never banned):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tE5IB.jpg This is why I left /r/athiesm and stopped reading /r/athiesmplus.\n\nHe/she in no way was pushing a male agenda, nor denying a feminist opinion or attacking such. He/she was engaging in a logical path of not blaming an entire group for the actions of an individual. Your modding is leading others to have a bad image of your group, but as for myself, rather than doing that I will only hold that you cannot moderate without having your own agenda inserted into it. Re-read what logic11 says, as it was in no way grounds for any sort of warning/ban. I am in no way associated with him, and I have no intention of returning to /r/athiesm or any subreddit of such because for a group for athiests, logic and non-emotional arguments do not exist there.\n\nThe following comments ensued, thus reinforcing he/she refuses to have an actual discussion in the forum he/she mods, and rather seeks only friendly opinions:\n\n&gt;If you want to talk about it take it to modmail.\n\nI'd rather take it here, as you were in the wrong.\n\n&gt;Then nope.

If you've ever been part of a support group you would understand that blaming a group for the actions of an individual goes against the principles of the wiki's you cite. Obviously you are against anyone having an opinion different than yours, and only cite from sources that are biased to your point rather than neutral and would allow those who seek a "safe space" progress, rather than reinforcement of what they perceive. I seriously hope you seek out actual training before you provide further guidance to those in need.	1347378395
Hey jerr instead of telling you its bs id ask what claim are they making specifically and try to find the specific sources of said claims.

It looks like that is a meta study of studies. It found a lot of articles and looked only at the scholarly ones that were double blinded and such.\n\nThey report, in the discussion section:\n\n&gt;Our findings show that no compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover.\n\nHowever, years of reading scholarly articles has taught me that the discussion section means jack shit. It's also known as the "let me frame my findings so you agree with what I'm looking for." By definition, it's not blind, so you should take what you find there with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you look at the results section, you get this:\n\n&gt;Four randomised controlled trials tested dietary supplements: Borago officinalis (borage), Cynara scolymus (artichoke), Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear), and a yeast based preparation. **Two trials reported intergroup differences for** an overall symptom score and for the individual symptoms **restlessness, discomfort, and impatience**.25 28 In the first of these trials the effectiveness of **γ linolenic acid from B officinaliswas** tested in people who attended a private party.25 The results indicated a **significant reduction in the overall severity of hangover** and in the individual symptoms of headache, laziness, and tiredness compared with placebo (P &lt; 0.01). Another trial tested a combination preparation containing **250 mg dried yeast, 0.5 mg thiamine nitrate, 0.5 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride, and 0.5 mg riboflavin** per tablet in participants who consumed vodka (40% volume alcohol) amounting to a total of 100 g absolute alcohol.28 The **difference in the change for the symptoms discomfort, restlessness, and impatience was statistically significant in favour of the yeast preparation.** Two other trials that tested extracts of **C scolymus and O ficus-indica reported no intergroup differences** for their main outcome measures.26 27\n\nThat seems to say that some of the non-conventional remedies work.\n\nIt continues:\n\n&gt;Four trials tested conventional agents: tropisetron, propranolol, tolfenamic acid, and fructose or glucose (table). **One trial reported intergroup differences for an overall symptom score** (P &lt; 0.01).31 This trial tested the **prophylactic effectiveness of tolfenamic acid**, an inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis. Each participant consumed alcohol in small groups and drank at his own pace. The amount of alcohol and food ingested was not measured. The overall symptom score and the individual symptoms headache, nausea, vomiting, thirst, dry mouth, tremor, and irritation were significantly reduced compared with placebo. **Three other trials, which tested propranolol, tropisetron, and fructose or glucose, reported no beneficial intergroup differences.**\n\nSo... 3/8 remedies studies showed statistically significant ways to reduce the effect of a hangover.\n\nHow did we get the conclusion:\n\n&gt;Our findings show that no compelling evidence exists to suggest that any complementary or conventional intervention is effective for treating or preventing the alcohol hangover.\n\nThe answer is that the authors are scoundrels. Even cherry picking studies, they couldn't get the conclusion they wanted, so they just *made it up*.	1323188337

I think the point is, world leaders should not gather in secret. For example, there are laws in the US that prevent these sort of meetings, alliances, ect. If you have a motorcade protecting you, there are likely laws protecting your citizens; these laws usually outlaw secret memberships and alliances for the leaders. These people are bound to put their nation first, yet generally they seem to work for this one world government that that undermines their own government.\n\nThat should sum up the problem people see with Builderburg.	1302664249

That wasnt a snide jab at you, by the way...you can clearly spell and read. \n\nAnyway, you are assuming: \n\n1. That the people in the article really do have a paranormal beliefs and no mental illness. The two can show up together, but having a mental illness means that person is not in the correct frame of mind for basic understanding of logic, science or social interactions. A good example is that there are people who really are presidents and people with mental illnesses who think they are the president. They do not belong to the same group. \n\n2. You are assuming that I believe in exorcisms, demons, etc.. \n\nI would also say that you are assuming that belief in the paranormal is the same as being in a cult, but that isnt as much of an assumption as it is a misunderstanding of the definition of "cult". Unless you are thinking aboit it differently or have a different understanding or are not referring to interest/belief in the paranormal but something different...in which case, my mistake and I will ask you to elaborate. \n\nSorry if I sound like a dick, but when I am trying not to offend anyone I tend to speak more...formally(?)...and that is often misconstrued as me being condescending, so I just want to assure you that isnt the case.

I cant stand when someone only is polite or gives the benefit of the doubt to only those with like-minded thoughts. \n\n\n\nEDIT: I am seeing some spelling errors...whoops.

I once had to sit through an entire dinner with my girlfriend at the time and listen to her whole family discuss homeopathy, runes, tarot, zodiac alignment and Feng fucking Shui.  \n\nSince this was the first time I had met them, I just feigned general interest, asked questions and made them explain things to me like a child so I understood and they felt intellectually rich in "opening my eyes to the spiritual world".\n\nIn regards to scary stuff, relax and just enjoy the atmosphere, you'll probably be made to jump a few times, they might do a table raising trick, might have spooky knocks and things going on in dark corners etc, just act scared so it increases the experience for your girlfriend or hell even try and scare her more!	1349952862

I would recommend following your dentist's instructions for managing your fluorosis and preventing fluorosis in your child's developing teeth. Children are more sensitive to fluoride. You should determine the amount of fluoride in your drinking water, and if the amount is higher than what your dentist recommends, then you should limit your child's consumption of that water. There are filters that you can purchase that would lower the level of fluoride in your water.\n\nFluorosis should no longer be a problem for you, as it affects developing teeth, not erupted teeth.\n\nSkeletal fluorosis should not be a problem for the average person in the US. If the fluoride level in your water is at a normal level, you shouldn't worry about it. It usually affects people living in areas with very high levels of fluoride in the water (such as China), or industrial workers who are exposed to abnormally high levels of fluoride.\n\nAdverse effects from fluoride are uncommon unless you are receiving abnormally high amounts of fluoride. There are many known adverse effects from fluoride, but the amount of fluoride in drinking water is controlled in order to avoid them. There are no known adverse effects in populations receiving the current safe level of fluoridated water (the 0.5-1.5 mg/L range).\n\nAgain, talk to your dentist. If he says avoid fluoridated water, then by all means avoid it. But it's not like fluoride is this new, unknown substance with unknown long-term effects. It's been studied for more than 70 years.	1344783675

This is a serious device designed for a serious purpose. For some unknown reason, certain individuals are often targeted by alien beings on a repeated basis. Once you have been abducted, your chances for re-abduction increase significantly. Most of my clients are repeat abductees. One of my clients, who is only 33 years old, has been abducted 7 times in the past 4 years. They are crippled by their anxiety, wondering when the next attack will be, wondering when they aliens may decide to keep their unwilling subject for good.	1330469396

I'm in CT, and there are tons of places.  New England being the longest settled and very populated area breeds a lot of ghost legends.  Whether or not they are "really" haunted is debatable.  My brother wrote the book "Old Ghosts of New England" which is a travel guide to haunted areas (many in CT).  \n\nI recommend contacting a local paranormal society or a group with some amount of legitimacy and ask to accompany them.  Otherwise if you turn up to many haunted locations you'll have the cops called on you.  \n\nA lot of people in CT go to Dudleytown.  I've had some creepy experiences there, but I'm fairly sure a lot of it was a case of group think or in my head.  Again, this is a location that is potentially dangerous (when I went, there were some fairly steep drops that come out of nowhere), and if spotted the police will be called.\n\nWhen I started going to haunted areas, I went to this site : http://www.theshadowlands.net/places/massachusetts.htm\n\nThat's the MA link.  That site doesn't look like its been changed in ten years, so I'm not sure how up to date it is.\n\nGood luck!	1347282358

Calcium Fluoride is indeed accumulated in the bones and teeth. However, that does not make Fluoride an _essential_ nutrient, such as Potassium or Magnesium, that facilitate vital functions in the body. Lead and cadmium are also found in the teeth and bones.\n\nHighly concentrated [Fluouride tabs or drops](http://www.drugs.com/mtm/fluoride.html) are technically are a prescription drug. There's also been a [petition](http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07p0070/07p0070.htm) for the FDA to classify fluoride as a drug for use in tooth application, tooth paste and bottled water.\n\nEdit: the FDA does not recognize fluoride as a nutrient, thus does not require a Daily Value (DV) for it be listed. Please see http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/FoodLabelingGuidanceRegulatoryInformation/RegulationsFederalRegisterDocuments/ucm073531.htm (page 62151).	1347256871

Some of them view it as an attack by satan. No, seriously. Then you can get even more fringe (though still a surprising amount of people) who believe the push to deny creationism (and therefore god) is actually apart of "End Times Prophecy". \n\nIn my opinion the biggest hurdle that you'll face when it comes to having someone accept that creationism is false, is what that will mean to their very view of their god. Most accept that Jesus was necessary because of what happened in the Garden of Eden. If the Garden of Eden didn't exist, then the fall didn't happen, and then Jesus's sacrifice was unnecessary or....didn't happen at all. It's a slippery slope that I don't think many in the creationist movement want to face.	1350587516

I live in southern Finland and there is this one place, Erkylän kartano (Erkylä's mansion) which is said to be haunted.\n\nThe story tells about a butcher and his family, and they lived near the mansion, presumably working for the lord who owned the mansion. The father of the family, the butcher, drank really heavily and some night he lost his mind over something that I don't know and slaughtered his wife and children.\n\nNow it's said that when you pass the old abattoir in midnight you can hear children crying and see lights flickering.\n\nI apologize if the grammar is bad.

So then what you mean is not that you're looking for someone or a party which follows the tenets of the constitution, but rather, someone or a party which conforms to the tenets that you happen to agree with, and disagrees with the tenets that you happen to disagree with, yes?\n\nWhich is good, and what I was trying to get at. The constitution is not the holy writ of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. It's a flawed document written by flawed men who decided to redraft the constitution after the first flawed US constitution failed. And this all occurred in the 18th century, a time so removed from today that a moderate position then would be seen as an absurdly reactionary position today.	1285161865

I have to say, I'm happy with their plugging of the new show.  For one thing, I'd completely forgotten about it.  Aside from that, they blatantly plugged at the beginning and end because, yes, they *are* going for publicity here, and otherwise just answered their questions honestly and only mentioned the new show when it was truly relevant to the question.  It's way more annoying when people continually try to awkwardly work whatever they're publicizing into every comment.\n\n(I know you were kidding, I just wanted to comment on their method.)	1317850871
I think Bob Lazar pretty much summed it up in his statements. He felt that he wasn't the most qualified guy for the project he was on (and could name a list of better candidates) and he didn't think their psychotic security procedures were at all productive. I agree with him, but it's easy to agree with a smart guy like Lazar.\n\nI don't think the governments of the world are going to have a choice much longer. We have the internet now. UFO sightings are increasing dramatically worldwide. Clearly they're going to make themselves known. Apparently it's not us who ultimately get to decide when contact is made. We have nuclear power. We've already left the planet multiple times. We have computers. We may not yet qualify to join the United Federation of Planets (or whatever intergalactic UN is) but we're definitely a good candidate for contact now.\n\nSecrecy is only an aid to advancement when there are people who try to stop your advancement because they're threatened by it in some way. (See also stem cell research, atomic bomb, cloning, free energy, current Iran crisis, North Korea, water cars, electric cars, etc.)\n\nIf they don't know you're building the Iron Man armor, they can't stop you.\n\nNote that another issue here has been that multiple government agencies and branches of the military have competed for resources, control, and access to captured extraterrestrial technology and life forms. There is no "government" even with the alleged influence of MAJ. There is only individuals and factions all trying to get resources and control secretly. If one of them gives the game away, they lose.\n\nYou really want an end to UFO secrecy? Put 8 billion dollars into lobbying for it. That should do it.\n\nThen we'll all have droids and land speeders and holograms, and we can join the federation or become jedi or whatever.\n	1331961091
&gt;Critics such as sociologist Claude Fischer argue that (a) Putnam concentrates on organizational forms of social capital, and pays much less attention to networks of interpersonal social capital; (b) neglects the emergence of new forms of supportive organizations on and off the Internet; and (c) the 1960s are a misleading baseline because the era had an unusually high number of traditional organizations.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam#.22Bowling_Alone.22	1356745073
Spotting a fallacy doesn't disprove the argument in question. It merely demonstrates a flaw in the line of reasoning used to come to a specific conclusion.

Ugh.  Wired was flirting with a lot of good ideas but didn't explain ANY of them well enough to implement.  \n\nWhile reading this list I asked myself "would following this advice allow me to detect fraud or crappy research in areas that skeptics know are BS?"  No, probably not.  The conflict of interest point is one people can probably understand, but none of the other descriptions of things to look for would enable someone to properly analyze a paper.  	1350362035

Not ... really?  You come up with a plan, everyone agrees to it, and everyone does the tasks they have agreed to.  Just because one or a few people come up with the plan, if they are the skilled ones in this example, doesn't imply anyone is "in charge" of anyone else.  They might just be good at making plans everyone agrees to.	1306222474
If that was what you were in fact trying to put across, I would agree with it.  However....\n\n'"Legit" chiropractic is unlicensed physical therapy' - 'unlicensed' here implies 'not legitimate'\n\n'osteopaths are not MD's, they are a form of alternative medicine'\n\n'"total body wellness".... is a red flag for alt-med'\n\nReferring to "Big Pharma" makes you a conspiracy theorist\n\nIts just...a bit black-and-white, tasuret, and smacks of insufficient skepticism about any pronouncement made by mainstream Western medicine.  I learned the bloody hard way to be skeptical of those too, and check them thoroughly before just going ahead and doing as told.  One should no more treat an MD as the font of all wisdom than allow the local witchdoctor to 'find out who was responsible for your curse and curse them in return'.  (Don't laugh, I've seen it. It was both preposterous and ugly.)  In all fairness, it is unreasonable to expect an MD to know every detail about every human illness, thus refusing to take any responsibility for your own problems.  Generally they will just look it up in the standard treatments manual, write you a script, ten minutes, job done.  \n\nIn my case, the standard treatment for my autoimmune disease when I was 2 was later discontinued because it caused stomach ulcers, amongst other things. More than one of my later GPs were somewhat horrified;  said they would never give any such treatment to anyone under the age of 12.  Unfortunately my parents weren't told about the ulcer risk (if the GP was even aware of it) - but too bad, the damage was done. I also went to what was considered the pre-eminent specialist hospital in the Southern hemisphere for the same autoimmune condition.  I double-checked their suggestions with various medical students and post-grads of my acquaintance;  they brought my attention to several horrendous side-effects that hadn't been mentioned and were generally of the opinion that someone as young as I was should find another way.  \n\nI did so. The things that worked were...non-standard, but worth trying to me because investigation revealed that, at worst, there was no harm in them.  As it happens, I was lucky enough to eventually find non-orthodox treatment that worked, and the only side-effects were good ones, i.e. other issues that I had incorrectly been viewing as wholly unrelated were also corrected.  It is interesting to me that I am starting to see aspects of this treatment pop up in research about the immune system.\n	1318921671
There is no fallacy involved in arguing that an assertion made by an authority is true.	1274028736
That's an oversimplification.\n\nThey were saying, if you question the people who lost relatives directly, calling them liars or conspirators when they obviously lost family members, you're a dick.  Some of them talked to loved ones on the phone minutes before they died, and unless they were riding on a missile at the time, most of the 9/11 conspiracy arguments don't account for that.\n\nIt's unreasonable to make wild accusations about 9/11 suggesting things like massive demolition projects with no real evidence, or assert baseless physics that have been ripped apart by respected physicists and engineers in reputable publications, when it's pretty fucking obvious what happened.\n\nActing like it's unreasonable that religious extremist terrorists could be convinced to fly planes into buildings isn't ignorant, it's stupid.\n\nCould Bush and Cheney have planned and funded the entire thing? Yes, of course.  But when people start constructing these ridiculous fantasies involving remote control planes and missiles and demolitions teams disguised as construction workers, you start to ignore evidence that doesn't suit the fantasy you've constructed in your mind. \n\nWhen a lot of so-called truthers get confronted with evidence, they fall back on "we're just asking questions."  Or else they try to argue their feelings and opinions as facts "Building 7 looked like a controlled demolition."  And in the case of Building 7, even going as far as accusing a first responder of being part of this conspiracy to kill thousands of his fellow citizens.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that Wolfowitz and Cheney were writing about trying to find a way to start a war with Iraq before 9/11, and it's not a coincidence the USAPATRIOT act was already written up and ready to go after 9/11, but when you start trying to turn it into a Tom Clancy novel with nothing but your feelings and self-proclaimed experts (who are always selling something), you enter into the realm of accusing the victims of wrong doing.	1325078125

The fact of the matter is that none of the models created with CO2 as the main driver of warming come even close to actual observations. The Alarmists jump up and down for joy and yell about how that means that the problem is far worse than they anticipated. Never does it enter their minds that the reason the models don't reflect reality is that the models fail utterly to account for other factors that are more powerful then CO2.	1355501096

Or the "Well, this one time someone said they're an atheist and said they don't like /r/atheism, so they must be really bad!" record?\n\nThe exact same arguments used against /r/atheism on Reddit are used against all atheists and atheism everywhere else on the internet. And it's all utter bullshit, perpetuated by people who want to feel vindicated in their personal bias. What is worse, you're *actually* buying in to the bullshit, probably out of peer pressure. Or maybe just to fulfill some bizarre need to feel superior.\n\nThere are actual problems with the content on /r/atheism, but it is nothing you can blame on the people there. Every single large, unmoderated subreddit is afflicted by the same problem: Banal, shallow, lowest common denominator content outnumbers insightful discussion a hundred to one -- and the reddit algorithm favors shallow content. The only reason /r/atheism attracts more attention is because of above mentioned bias against atheists and contrast in subject. Good quality content in /r/aww isn't that different from bad quality content in /r/aww, while as the spectrum from good to bad has much more depth when it comes to discussion about philosophy, theology and their effect on society.\n\nTL;DR: You are being misled by a bias in society, and laying the blame for a perceived lack of quality on /r/atheism itself demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of Reddit and how it works.	1341588943

Right. That's a loaded question. Begging the question would be something like: \n\n"Obama should be re-elected because he's the best president we've ever had"\n\nYour conclusion, "Obama should be re-elected" is actually less controversial of a claim than the premise ("Obama is the best president") in support of the conclusion.	1328567433

Not always. A lot of studies use convenience samples. The important thing is then listing it as a potential confounding variable and assessing whether it potentially affected the results. \n\nFor example, I just wrote a lab report on a false recognition phenomenon. A convenience sample (our tutorial classes) were used to replicate previous studies. There's no evidence that the phenomenon is related to IQ and it's unlikely the fact that we were all university students affects the results. It doesn't make the study invalid it's just important to note it.	1303975444
&gt;Liberal and yet defending anarchism and libertarianism. How odd.\n\nLiberal and yet pointing out bad arguments where I see them? Not odd at all. \n\n&gt;Liberal yet trying to argue that Somalia is now all better thankfully because of no more guvvvaaament.\n\nLiberal and yet not desperately clinging to the fantasy that government is a cure-all. Governments can and very often do get in the way of social and economic progress. That doesn't mean that government is bad - but that government must be handled very carefully, and the fact of the matter is that Somalia is better off in free market anarchy than it was under its terrible corrupt government.	1313609340

You really seem like you have something to prove. Don't do that, if you were actually being skeptical about this you would not sound like you were desperately trying to argue otherwise.\n\nYou are really clearly projecting yourself into this. Your experience, entirely based on your perception of your own intelligence, is a very bad way to attempt to prove something. In fact, you shouldn't be trying to prove anything.\n\nAlso, you have absolutely no right to go ahead and try to diagnose people who are actively in a study with personality disorders. You are resorting to, as we people of learning call it (sarcasm), making shit up (not sarcasm). \n\nI don't give a damn about the results of this study, though it might be an interesting read. People should be able to smoke pot in my book as long as they know what the effects are, good or bad. So keep out your own misrepresentations of possible misrepresentations of data, because there is already enough pseudoscientific crap to sort through without a bunch of people trying to validate a substance habit. 	1346497509

There are people who homebrew Chinese lanterns; I was witness to two red lanterns on New Years Eve 2009/2010. That January a local free publication ran an interview with a man who claimed he had launched three red lanterns connected with wires; the lights were seen all over the county. I am assuming that by the time they had floated over my area, one of the lanterns burned out, which would explain why they were losing altitude. I didn't see them crash because I went back into the house to get a pair of binoculars, but when I came back less than a minute later, they were gone.\n\nThese blobs of light that "eazyeyall" photographed were far too far apart to be Chinese lanterns in some sort of wire formation, notice that there is a light hanging below the other two....I think it would be hard to launch a vertical Chinese lantern triangle without lighting the top lanterns first, so the bottom light should not have burnt out first.\n\nSo yes, I'm not convinced these lights were Chinese lanterns, but I have seen lanterns in the past and was not fooled by them.	1326507734
How does this get so many upvotes?  It's only on the surface that this comment sounds insightful.  \n\nThis planet would be ultra-frozen all the time.  Mars is pretty nearly always frozen, and it's only the 4th planet.  This would certainly be.\n\nIt would also likely be a gaseous planet, since hydrogen compounds freeze past the "frost line," which is between Mars and Jupiter, and which explains why the subsequent planets are all gaseous.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics)\n\nIf life was created in a specific set of conditions that, out of the planets in our solar system, only Earth has---chances are that there's a very good reason for this.  There are molecular, REAL properties that dictate why life needs water, for example.\n\nThis sort of comment reminds me when people say, "maybe aliens have three legs for all we know!"  Well, maybe they do, but probably not.  Two legs and four legs are the most efficient systems and even numbered, which is why animals evolved them.	1344634417

&gt;I would contend that this is not actually faith, but a conclusion based on the observation that most people tend to be decent people most of the time. \n\nThat doesn't sound very scientific.  Because it isn't.  Some things aren't realistic to do double blind studies of.  Society doesn't work without faith (or trust).  Just because most people seem alright does not mean everyone is.  We have a lot of assumptions (faith or lack of evidence) about our daily lives and even the worldin general. (How many scientific theories or discoveries do you test for yourself?)\n\nIn the religious sense it should still be respected, or more accurately its power.	1285526940

For us, it's not about the ratings or contracts. It's about bringing solid proof and evidence to the general public. We are passionate about what we do, and who doesn't want to make a living doing what they love? We would be perfectly content with a web series or something of the like, but speaking honestly and realistically, that will not pay the bills, so we would not be able to devote as much time to our investigations as we would like to. If we can practice our passion without having to balance all of our day jobs, we can put our full energy and focus towards finding the best possible proof of the paranormal that we can. We feel as a group that TV is the ideal media for sharing our findings with a broad audience. Our hope is to make believers out of skeptics by using real evidence rather than gimmicks. I'm sorry if you feel this reflects poorly upon us as a group. I sincerely hope one day you will be able to view our work, and maybe we can change your mind about it. 	1344963044

The emphasis in the grandparent comment is on the word "people". The emphasis in the article (and study) is on the word "men." if you read the title and abstract of the paper you will see it is NOT about "people" and how they all behave the same. It is about how men behave differently than women.\n\nIf you read the grandparent's follow-up, you'll see no complaint about the use of the word stupid. He/she is just concerned about gender versus race versus class. You have projected your concern into someone else's comment.\n\nThe use of the word "stupid" is allowable by creative license. It is obviously not a technical term. But cognitive impairment is one valid definition for the word stupid.	1331791183

As a former nutbag Fundamentalist, and autism mom, watching the Northern Lights, volcanoes, or MRIs of brain structure are **more** incredible when you have science as a backdrop. \n\nWith all due respect to Arthur C. Clarke, he was wrong when he said that 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'.  There's a big difference between 'I don't want to believe' and  \n'this is what science shows, and our knowledge is still not comprehensive'.  Science can show me why the Aurora Borealis occurs in certain places, and not in others.  Brain scans can show me tumours, deficiencies in brain structure and connections, and often, why people act like they do.   We still have no idea (really) how the brain works, and that is isn't a horrible thing.  It's very frustrating, at times, but science is not magic.  I might prefer to have Gandalf patrolling my kids' neurons and saying "You shall not pass" to every aggressive and self-injurious impulse,  but science actually saved one daughter's life when she had cancer, and it would likely give my other kids a better life, except that we haven't quite cracked that particular (autism) code yet. \n\nScience still can't explain when 'life' begins, or when it ends.  That's not a failure of science, that's a sign that we still have more to learn.  What we have learned so far is incredible.  \n\nScience isn't magic.  It doesn't have all of the answers.  The answers that it does have (what creates DNA, how is a person or animal created and why does it die, what the fuck is up with an opossum?) are already incredible.  Religion has been trying to answer questions for a good number of millenia, and (with all due respect to religious people), they still don't seem to have answers.  I've seen more 'magic' and wonder in science than I'm likely to ever see in any other place.  \n\n	1301088001
So [this guy](http://www.sdh-fact.com/CL02_1/41_S3.pdf) is who you hang your hat on? A one trick Japanese denier/historian?	1321100788
Well, thanks for reading it. It's fairly long in comparison to some posts!\n\nAlthough Crichton was an author, he was also an MD and spent some time as a post-doc fellow, so, he is not without scientific education. After reading some of his material, watching some of his lectures, and seeing some of the interviews he did (i sought them out after reading this), i have to say, personally, I can't find any fault with what he says in any of them, or this piece in particular. He does analyze the language used, but IMHO, the language he is commenting on, are examples where scientists stepped over the mark. In my opinion, a scientist has a responsibility to use language *very* carefully/cautiously. So he calls a few well known individuals out? I'm not against that, I think it's healthy!\n\nI believe Crichton makes a fantastic case, that caution has somewhat been thrown to the wind, when it comes to some science, and that the line between science and policy has become very blurred indeed, and in 2003, he was *warning* us not to believe everything we read, and not to accept things on the basis of "consensus" opinion.\n\nJust before I go any further, I don't particularly like the term "denier", it makes anyone who wants to ask legitimate questions or check facts until they are convinced either way (which is the core of science), sound like Nazi's. Fair enough if you want to use it, but i just don't buy it and it has no place in debate as far as i personally am concerned. It's tarring everyone with the same brush.\n\nI'm not sure where you think he is wrong though, or where you think his logic is flawed, or how he came down on the wrong side? Crichton has on several occasions said that he didn't claim that some kind of climate event wasn't happening. He was just questioning a lot of the science behind it. He was opening a debate on some areas which had an aura on infallibility. Again in my opinion, he was correct to question "models", especially the "faith" that is put in them. So, Crichton wouldn't actually fall into the whole "denier" category. He was just engaging in scientific debate. He was being skeptical. He was talking about the over-use of extrapolation, in areas where sometimes science doesn't have all the answers, where it is not infallible.\n\nI'm not going to comment on your first link, simply because i think that issue is far too emotive, and I could only make a comment after looking at hard data. Which I don't have access to. Also I'd like to add, that this Crichton's lecture is from 2003, so in fairness, there wasn't as much debate back then (or the same level of visceral mud slinging), at least not from what i remember. \n\n&gt;He clearly thinks the researchers are biased, so I wonder what he'd say about the recent study funded by deniers.\n\nWell, i'm a scientist, and i am biased. We all are. It's one of the hardest elements to deal with in the scientific process. Crichton, was just stating this reality, and suggesting that bias in certain fields can have a massive effect, perhaps not always on results, but certainly the interpretation of results. (the latter i think is what a lot of the mud-slinging is about these days, at least between scientists, not really the results themselves). Any scientist who claims to be wholly without bias, isn't a very good scientist, again in my opinion.\n\nYour second link by the way, I'm sorry, I can't see hard data, so again, I'm not going to comment. I see what you are saying, but I also see its a privately sponsored study, so, it's doesn't matter what side of the argument it came down on, I wouldn't personally comment on it unless i saw the hard data, and had the time to analyse it myself. For all i know, Mr. Koch has bought a controlling interest in a wind turbine manufacturer. The study may be absolutely flawless in it's accuracy and interpretation. I simply just don't know either way. I'm a skeptic :)\n\n&gt;I also find it funny that he discussed cases where it took a long time for the truth to be taken seriously and ignores the fact that global warming has been discussed and largely ignored for decades.\n\nYour link for this is to an Issac Asimov video. What a great writer! I loved his foundation series when i was in college. He is talking about the green-house effect though. *That's not the same* as "global warming", and certainly is not the same as the more contemporaneously used term "climate change". It's just not the same thing. The former describes an effect, which is in turn a reported factor in the second, which has itself become confused with the third, of which it is but one possibility. Again, Crichton never confirms nor denies Global warming, it was ancillary to his main points, which address how some of the ideas have come about, how debate was stifled, and how the lines between popular policy and good science have become blurred. Again, i have seen Crichton state for the record on many occasions that he believed that some kind of climate change was occurring (but i don't want to quote him as i can't remember his exact words!).\n\nHe sums up towards the end in saying this:\n\n&gt;If we were to address the land temperature records with such\nrigor, we would be well on our way to an understanding of exactly how much faith we can place in global warming, and therefore with what seriousness we must address this.\n\nSo all he is really saying on that particular issue is, (in my opinion), is I'm not overly impressed by what i've seen so far, this needs to be more rigorously looked at, not in terms of popular public policy, but in terms of the hard science. Then, and only then, should we decide what action to take.\nIMHO, there is nothing wrong with that. If you aren't happy with something, you need to investigate more, measure twice, cut once!\n\nAnyway, I'm glad you found it interesting. As i did.\n	1352595930

However isn't "caring about the average person" supposed to be the premise of democracies and western governments?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not so naive as to accept the public premise of what government claims to be. Since you do not care about the average person, perhaps you can then answer honestly: what is the actual motivation behind what you advocate?\n	1328751931
Yes, it is. \n\nI'm just asking what the possibilities are. We shouldn't talk like we know unless we actually know. Large corporations are likely to work with governments to suppress information. I don't think the possibility is out of the question.	1343850222

None of this sound good. Loosely put it sound's like you got some unnatural attention, much like a stalker IRL. This is similar to the experiences of the dark and moody friend in my story. Concerned about the hoof prints as this states something with definition and possibly personality.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to point out though the difference in modern terminology between a poltergeist and an possibly demonic entity. A poltergeist usually seems to be a dark entity, but with exploration of the malevolent phenomena the "entity" will lack any sense of definable features such as personality or an independent sense of intelligence. This is because a poltergeist is thought to be a projection of psychokinetic energy usually from the victims of the haunting experience. Think of it functioning similar to a robot operated by you're thoughts and negative emotions that you have a very minimal level of control of (if you are in fact the person who is generating the poltergeist phenomena.)\n\nWhat is called a demonoid, or demonic entity is usually very similar to this, except for one key difference. This perceived entity the victims have no control over it, it operates with it's own sense of intelligence, it gives the impression of a usually unlikable personality, tricks you, etc. So the end result is all the negative experiences of a poltergeist, but is seems to be a being, and not a mere manifestation of energies.\n\n   	1323806865

&gt; Tell your friend he isn't in a scheme to make money, he's involved in a financial terrorist scheme, which will probably fail since any canny investors involved will sell off their silver before the JP Morgan payback moment, bursting the bubble and causing the crash early.\n\nThe backwardation, i.e. not enough silver (and gold as well) to cover the paper sold against it is getting worse and can only end one way. The Indians, Chinese, Iranians, Saudi/middle east oil producers and many other countries with huge $US reserves have been and are getting into metals to hedge against the dollar collapse.\n\nThe fundamentals (not enough metal for buyers) are plain as day, so it won't fail and JP Morgan and the Fed will die. However, I do agree it's not about making money, it's about preserving wealth in a something that has history as a currency on its side. \n\nFiat currencies are on a race to the bottom because what's happening now is exactly the same as every other fiat currency in history; greedy bankers and their rich friends printing paper currency at an alarming rate until it's worthless. No fiat currency has lasted longer than 100 years, but 'we' keep letting banksters run the show until they fuck it up, *again*.\n\nI didn't learn that at school, did you? Wonder why...	1302651905
I consider this a wholly despicable idea, for two reasons really. \n\nFirst, if the scientists don't educate, than who will? Let's say I'm an average Joe, and I don't believe in man-made climate change. Is some scientist who refuses to explain the evidence ridiculing me (or whoever I got my information from) really going to convince me I'm wrong? \n\nSecondly, and this is a big one, I'm a physicist and while I know that these haven't become quite as political, but there are many people who don't believe in quantum mechanics or relativity. I do not mock these people. As a community, I do not feel that physicists mock these people. We do have spokesmen (like Stephen Hawking, for instance) who explain these concepts really well to the common man. I would gladly explain the evidence for any of these theories. And most importantly, every physicist I know understands the weaknesses in quantum theory (which all theories have, even climate change) and do not say things like "the debate is over."	1332858404

Well, I'm mildly OCD so I have a lot of ritualized actions or unecessary requirements when I do things, but I don't think that really counts.\n\nAs for superstitions:\n\nI have tons of superstitions when I'm doing something competitive (poker, sports, etc ...) and I'm sure everyone has heard of them, they're common ones.  Uncommonly, I don't believe in ghosts or spirits at all ... except when in Hawai`i.\n\nI'm hawaiian and there's a long history of beliefs in spiritual stuff, including night-marchers.  Nigh marchers come down from the mountains at night, beating drums, and they walk set paths.  If you find yourself in their path and you're a non-native they will kill you, if you are a native you have to follow certain procedures or they kill you.\n\nRelated to that, it's bad luck to live in a house that has the front and back doors aligned, to whistle at night, or to live in a building along one of the supposed paths.  \n\nIt is, of course, nonsense ... but that doesn't stop me from believing in it.  :)	1256129205

True, but statistically speaking this fetus is likely to have problems if they are feet first instead of head first so late in term.

 &gt; the government wouldn't lie about vaccines; it's too important to public health  \n  \nThat wasn't my point at all. As I said in the first reply, it's about who can be targeted to be exploited. I'm not surprised that a town in Pakistan would be targeted to find Osama Bin Laden, but that's different from experimenting on the American Public. It's ethically just as wrong, but the scope, political blowback, and potential motives are completely different. And don't put words in my mouth, I don't condone these actions by the CIA. 	1356549950
It can be like that.  Consider the differences between doing drills, sparring and an actual bout in boxing (just picked that art as an example).  In the first both parties know what's going on, in the second it may or may not be part scripted for training purposes, in the third...no real clue is to be had.\n\nUnfortunately some people do think the actual training forms **are** the art, not just practise/conditioning.  To stick with boxing, it would mean thinking that hitting a semi-stationary pad someone is holding conveniently our for you **is** boxing.\n\nAnd, of course, some (a lot?  I've not done a survey) of it is genuine, 100%, unadulterated bollocks.	1353606833

Yes but the statement you quoted doesn't say doctors are sinister and purposely keep you sick to make more money.  \n\nA company working for profits won't have incentive to really cure a disease to the point that we would see it eradicated, where the company would not make money off of a cure.  It's not that the people in the company are evil or trying to keep people sick, and they probably wish they could research a true 'cure' but they would also say 'well unfortunately we can't throw money away on research that won't give us a return on our investment.'\n\nWhat I worry about is that 'skeptics', in a knee jerk reaction against homeopathy and people who think doctors are out to get us, will ignore the real problems that seem to exist in the medical industry in a for profit system.  "No no, the medical industry is GREAT!"\n\nIt's like what FA Hayek said in the Road to Serfdom.  He said laissez-faire capitalism would not work, and that people in his social circles knew it... but they had fought against socialism (real socialism) so long, that they eventually got more and more extreme in their view, ultimately telling people that full blown laissez-faire capitalism was the answer to everyone's problems.  	1335522221

If you follow East Coast anthropological history, these type of reports are out there in the historical record, so it's good to have someone talking about it, why ignore it? \n\nWhat we do need is actual scientists with expertise in these fields at least providing some sort of counterpoint. \n\nIn instances like this I think one of the problems you run up against is actual archaeologists and anthropologists are reluctant to compromise their own reputations on what's perceived as fringe science.

So... the real problem here is that for damn near 100 years, various and sundry agencies have been *trying* to use scopolamine as a truth serum.    It's actually pretty useful for [motion sickness](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682509.html) and as a palliative sedative for end of life care.  However, in 1914 a doctor in Texas [discovered that it lowers inhibitions.](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755351,00.html)  Big whoop.  So does valium.  So does alcohol.  So do lots of things.\n\nThing is, if you're trying to find things that lower inhibitions *at all costs* it's one of the drugs you try.  Like the OSS did.  Like the CIA did.  It's worth noting that they certainly didn't limit their experiments to scopolamine - [they tried weed, acid, MDMA, you name it.](http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/war/mkultra/mkultra_timeline.php)\n\nHOWEVER\n\nIf you look up "weed" or "acid" or "LSD" or "MDMA" or any of the other drugs that are actually *fun* to do, you find all sorts of information about how much FUN they are.  If, on the other hand, you look up scopolamine, you discover that it's\n\na) [useful in treating motion sickness](http://boingboing.net/2007/09/27/scopolamine-zombie-d.html)  and\n\nb) [crazy-ass tinfoil hat territory.](http://scopolamineisland.com/Background.html)\n\nThere have been and always will be mysterious rumors about drugs that people haven't encountered in the wild that cause you to do all sorts of terrible crazy things ("bath salts" anyone?).  They add to the allure of narcotics and to the dire warnings of the DARE crowd.  Thing is, if there were such a drug out there that completely "zombied" you out, how many different segments of society can you think of that would find a way to use that to their advantage post-haste?\n\n[There is science here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_drug) but c'mon - if anything worked as well as the paranoiacs claimed, war would have ended about the time sodium pentothal was invented.	1347503437

&gt;Nobody is willing to go through economic hardship now to save future generations from being fucked.\n\nHere is where the real discussion is, but I wouldn't say "most" of the world lives in denial in the way you put it. It's not so black and white. I would say that those keen to embrace *every* Global Warming policy designed to slow its spread are in denial about the costs. I would say those that hesitate to embrace *any* sort of policy designed to subdue Global Warming are in denial about the dangers. I would say those that simply refuse to admit the existence of Global Warming are in denial about the facts.\n\nAs per the reasons why the fight against global warming has slowed in recent years, I think there are many world leaders who think something should be done, but are also realistic in face of the largest economic depression the world has seen since the great depression. I believe Obama falls into this category, though he'd never admit it to his constituents.	1354647997

&gt;Further, even if it were the cause, it's not necessarily an indictment of chiropractic, any more than the existence of malpractice is an indictment of conventional medicine.\n\nTrue, but it is a problem when we consider that chiropractic has no benefits or effectiveness for treating any condition. This means that the presence of any negative consequence (whether it's a stroke or just an increased risk of getting a rash) makes the practice unethical and is an indictment of chiropractic. \n\nThis is why comparing risks and deaths to actual medicine is always fallacious because it ignores the cost:benefit ratio. So whilst it's true that actual medicine carries more dangers than ear candling, to treat the dangers of actual medicine to the dangers of ear candling as equivalent, without reference to the corresponding benefits of each treatment, is misleading. 	1349400520

It depends on the women; fear is not something easily controlled from outside. \n\nDownvote me all you want, but that doesn't change the fact the only thing that could would satisfy the insecurity of very fearful women would require a complexity of social control rivaling the fascism you can see in Saudi Arabia and other similar places: no woman goes anywhere outside without a male chaperon/guardian that is a relative and she is not allowed to talk to strangers.  That guarantees a lot of security.  Free societies, however, demand "thick skinned" individuals or the bravery to go out and be vulnerable, and this is both for women and men.\n\nTo put my point simply:  **currently, you can't have a society that holds individual freedom high while also having very deep and efficient  mechanisms of control for ugly speech and other bad behaviors.** \n\nSo,\n\n&gt;Are you really trying to argue, that it is impossible to have a convention without women being afraid of sexual assault? Seriously?\n\nYes, unless it's a small convention where people know each other better and the situation is easier to control.  Don't forget, I'm speaking of the fear, not of actual assaults.	1351168235
Well, in a sense it is my choice to make. What we are arguing about here, as far as I can tell, is tacit acceptance. You are proposing tacit acceptance for any treatment that works as well as placebo. My choice, as a skeptic, is whether to endorse or oppose that proposal.\n\nI'd like to make a counter-proposal: any placebo that we even *consider* treating as an acceptable option should be shown to do no more harm than pouring water on somebody's shirt.\n\nHere we have a woman who is actively claiming the existence of unreal entities who speak to you, who are unseen by others, and who give you good advice. This is incredibly dangerous for any of the sixty million people in this world who have schizophrenia. It is the mental equivalent of telling peanut allergy sufferers that the swelling sensation they feel after eating nuts is the body purging itself of toxins.\n\nThere are hundreds of cases of mentally ill individuals taking the advice of unseen forces and killing or maiming others. So offhand, I'd say this *particular* placebo has to be acknowledged as potentially harmful and I will be withholding my tacit acceptance.\n\nYou're free to offer your tacit acceptance, but I would suggest that *assuming* a marginal psychosomatic benefit is more important than potential harm is hardly skeptical. It's an act of faith, particularly when those same placebo benefits can be obtained without resorting to loony fictions and outright fraud. 	1300492862

Except he wasn't replying directly to Watson, he was replying to Phil Plait's "potential rapist" article which Myers linked to.  \n\nYou could interpret it as telling her to "shut up" but that's not what he was doing.  He was saying it was a non issue regarding "women's rights".  That Watson felt creeped out is a subjective, individual feeling.  It does not follow that she gets to appropriate the entire feminist movement with one fell swoop to educate the rest of us on elevator etiquette.  Dawkins was perfectly within the bounds of civility when he pointed out that the rank hysteria blowing up over a "potential rape" is a non issue when compared to absolute real issues of women being tortured, beaten, raped, killed and mutilated all over the world.  \n\nWhat Watson experienced was a first world issue.  A guy asked you up to his room for coffee while in an elevator.  Watson declines.  Guy sheepishly goes his own way.  \n\nHer initial reaction on Youtube (though presumptuous and self serving) was quite benign.  It was certainly nothing to get rilled up about.  People have opinions all the time that are contrary to others.  This has never been about the initial incident.  This has always been about the blow up after the incident, which started with Watson's incredibly bad behavior by calling out McGraw in public.  \n\nThat was always the issue people had with her.  They pointed out that bad behavior, Phil Plait and PZ Myers piled on with their "Always name names" and "Potential rapists" posts and then Dawkins got his shot in.\n\n\n\n	1321238884

Which is equally ridiculous.\n\nIf it were somehow possible for humanity to spew as much crap into the air and water with no ill effects, there would be evidence. It's absolutely ludicrous to believe that in a world as full of waste and destruction as our own, that a staggering 99.83% of the scientific community dedicated to climate research would unwaveringly commit to a global conspiracy designed to perpetuate a patently false myth about humanity's impact on the world in order to get us to subscribe to a green philosophy and fund green projects.\n\nKeeping in mind that the alternative would be to say "good news, all is well", in which case your task becomes much easier. You don't have to convince anyone to fund your green revolution, you can just dedicate yourself to research into more cost effective coal mining, or building a more powerful SUV, in which case you're likely to find people competing to fund your research that they may reap the rewards of your findings, rather than fighting tooth and nail for every dollar of funding for your algae power plant or your plan to increase solar panel efficiency by 5%.	1353779125

Why are you so upset about people asking questions and exploring possibilities? Why is that asinine to you?\n\nIf everything is so pedestrian and boring, why are you so worked up? The truth is that we only know of a fraction of the technological capabilities of the military. We know that 25% of their budget each year is eaten up by Black ops, which by definition means you have no idea what that represents.\n\nWhy are you so sure about what you know, and what do you not know? That is what I am asking here. As I said, i'm sure you have perfectly good explanations for all sorts of things you've heard from the government. I'm saying there might be more to the story. The OP seemed to be coming from this at the 'local' level, which to myself is interesting as well. There is always some little truth to every legend, imo. I have also never claimed this idea is absolutely or even most likely true.\n\nI didn't mean to call you or infer you are closed-minded. I do not think that. That being said, all of us can always try to open our minds up even more than we have previously, myself included. Sorry for the offense.	1339609907

Absolutely.. you've handled this post extremely well, and I really admire your thoroughness and respect throughout the discussion! I like it that you've had a really well researched and open mind, but still stand strongly by your own opinion - and force all the 'believers' to think hard and carefully about their views! I am still firm of the opinion that we are not alone in this universe, simply because of the size of the playing field - but I agree that there needs to be a lot better evidence presented before we can say for sure that they have interacted with us in the past. The most convincing arguments seem to come from ex-military/astronaut/other public figures, however obviously anyone can claim whatever they like, and who knows what their agenda is...\n\nHaving said that, let me quickly go a little off topic. To me, there seem to be just too many occurances of paranormal things (Astral Projections, Spontaneous Healing, Philadelphia Experiment, Laylines/earth's energy grid, Synchronicities, Collective Consciousness, the Nature of Personal Reality, etc etc) to be completely discounted, that lead me to believe at least SOME of them are true and that there is a significant area of biology/physics/neuroscience that we haven't even begun to fully understand. From my knowledge of QM I am aware of the significance conscious observation has on outcome, and the fact is that we still can't really explain what mediates non-local quantum effects (ie entanglement). Throw in the idea of time having three dimensions to allow for 'parallel' universes and the fact that there is most probably something that unifies gravity with the rest of the picture, I'd say its fairly likely that we develop some form of timetravel in the near to distant future, (providing we don't blow ourselves up first). It will probably involve black holes, and would be limited to consciousness only... who knows.\n\nMy point is this: perhaps we need to BELIEVE in aliens, so we imagine and attempt to explain/understand their technology - and simultaneously improve and enrich our lives. I find it facinating that a number of high level academics have on occasion claimed to have been contacted by ETs (Robert Anton Wilson writes a lot about this and lists Tesla, Buckminster Fuller, and a whole bunch of others I forgot). Perhaps our strong belief of aliens throughout history is as persistent as it is irrational, and it is simply 'thought energy' being projected through time by our future kind in order to assist ourselves by hinting at their supposed existence... So that we may better realise the malleability of reality.\n\nI don't know, im just kinda making this up as I go along, and I feel like I'm trying to explain something I have absolutely no idea about... I feel like I have 5 or maybe 6 pieces of a 1000 piece puzzle and am trying to guess what the final image looks like. But I feel like the end result is indeed extremely beautiful, and its still fun to speculate.	1343861432

It's not my intention to insult anyone. I don't "disagree" with a party the same way i don't "agree" with a party. I personally think subjects should be discussed independent of party representation. The post title is a quote from the article that gets to the heart of the ideas presented, not my opinion.\n\nYou've focused on the political aspects more than the skeptic-related points.\n\nRegardless of party, certain politicians may soon hold the most powerful political position in the United States. Regardless of party, US citizens with a potential to vote for said politicians have misinformation about scientific issues. Regardless of party, said politicians would rather knowingly refute scientific evidence to appease a likely voting base than stick to truth and reason (tenets of skepticism).\n\nWhile it's pretty evident that Prothero is biased in his writing, for me the main message of this post is that representative among roughly half of the voting population in the US is a popular idea (AGW skepticism/denial) that goes completely against the consensus of experts on the subject. Even worse, authority figures (potential future US presidents) would rather appease a misinformed mass than lead the way of science.\n\nSorry if the political aspects offended you, but such ideas are perfectly in line with this subreddit. It examines a social, scientific, and pseudoscientific controversy. It issues a resistance to the spread of pseudoscience and irrational beliefs. The link is from a blog which the founder of the Skeptics Society, Michael Shermer, contributes to.\n\nUntil your desire for not wanting politically related skeptical posts becomes consensus here, you should expect to see some politically related skeptical posts.\n\nIn my opinion you would do better to ignore the post based off its title, downvote it, or contribute intelligent counterpoints rather than blanketly provide faulty generalizations and insulting my post as "petty" and "bullshit."	1318329083

I take issue with the statement that Freud created "the only unified" theory "recognized by everyone". \n\nHe founded psychoanalysis, which was revolutionary in its time because it said man wasn't so much unlike animals, because man was also driven by lust, emotion and the subconcious. This gave a whole new view on mankind which opened up a lot of doors. He partly paved the path towards psychology. Someone like Ebbinghaus or Cattel (the first one, James McKeen) deserve much greater recognition when it comes to psychology.\n\nPsychoanalysis is also a bunch of horse manure. 	1329146780

Absence of evidence may not be evidence of absence, but absence of anything beyond "this exists because we believe it does" stemming from thousands of years ago when pretty much everything else with any predictive potential/factual claims attached to their 'grand theory', as it were, are provably incorrect, then I feel comfortable in hedging my bet in this uncertainty to a position of some kind of a functional certainty. \n\nWhen any claims an institution/authority makes that can be disproved are disproved and the rest are only considered credible because they are concepts or claims that can either never be disproved or proved or are formulated in a way that allows these goalposts to be moved indefinitely... well, you might not be able to disprove them, but neither do they carry any particular credibility. 	1305569002

Their information seems to focus on succinic acid (traditionally known as "spirit of amber", as it was originally extracted from ground amber) and its supposed benefits. It is typically used as a sweetener or flavoring agent in food production. I can't find any information on clinical studies, or any indication that simply wearing amber will allow it to enter your bloodstream (highly unlikely). There are a couple of in-vitro studies that show it might have some beneficial effects as an anti-oxidant, but in-vitro studies don't show how it actually acts in a human body.\n\nSuccinate is part of the Krebs cycle (cellular metabolism), but as far as I can see, your body gets all it needs naturally through the food you eat. Otherwise, we'd all be dead from not getting enough.\n\nBottom line, I think if their claims were true, you would have to keep buying more amber all the time because it would slowly break down and be absorbed by your skin. Furthermore, as a parent of two young children, my experience is that knowing whether your child is upset due to teething pain is hit and miss at best.\n\nNot surprisingly, you can buy succinic acid as a dietary supplement. It's probably a lot cheaper than buying an amber necklace. But it's a fat-soluble nutrient, so I would be aware of the fact that any excess that your body doesn't use tends to build up in your liver and can lead to toxicity. The FDA has no established safe dosage levels.\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR. The extent of my qualifications on this matter include 2 years studying biochemistry in the mid-90s and 20 minutes on Google.	1316120134

&gt;I find debunking articles filled with just as much propaganda and disinformation as the documentaries and articles they critique.\n\nYou should provide examples of this.  Are you getting your information from a reliable source?  What do you consider to be propaganda and disinformation?  You need to provide a direct link to a specific documentary or article that you have an issue with.  With that, it will be much easier to figure out if you just misunderstand the kind of skeptic this subreddit is for, if you have trouble understanding scientific evidence/reasoning, or if you're getting your "debunking" information from unreliable sources.	1342245965

The issue you have there is the likelihood that the plaintiff doesn't have the financial where-with-all to come up with the money, even if he were required to pay for the defense of the school district.  Once the school gets a judgment (and before they execute a lien), the guy files for bankruptcy protection, and the debt likely gets discharged.  This is because of the preferential order of creditor recovery in bankruptcy - taxes first, then secured creditors, then unsecured creditors.  Since most people in the US in this day and age really have no assets other than their house (which goes to the bank if the bank accelerates the note), there is no recovery for the school.	1340656412

I think what he's saying is that the subjective description of the problem changes after the delivery of the placebo.

Then you take a placebo, and say "4 out of 10", but only because you *think* you should be getting better, not because of any ACTUAL decrease in pain.	1311276654

I agree. EVP's that are clearly spoken sentences or music or laughing can be some pretty convincing evidence. I have never had a paranormal experience, and frankly I am pretty thankful for that. In some ways I envy those that have had experiences, but most of the time I feel like they are just embellishing a story or suffering from the effects of the brain trying to make sense of activity viewed in darkness with a heightened sense of dread and fear. In may ways I feel like paranormal activity is actually created by the witness by a lack of access to complete information. \n\nOf course, I have never put myself in a "haunted" situation, so my words lack the confidence brought about by experience. If ghosts do actually exist, I dont want one following me home. I dont want to open a door that I cant shut. Thats why I asked the question in my original post. I would like the experience of visiting a haunted location without actually doing it. 	1339905287

First, I feel we have to admit that Penn &amp; Teller could really just decide that they like the magician and want him to come over.  It doesn't have to be because they didn't figure out the trick.  \n\nSo, that said, we can assume that just because they looked at the envelope he used doesn't mean it wasn't a trick envelope.  They could merely have enjoyed his work and wanted him on the show.  Like wise, there's another magician who spells out a card with his deck -- that seems pretty straight forward (trick deck, specific cuts are used to spell words), but they seemingly get it wrong and are "fooled".  I feel it's more likely that they knew how he did it but were so impressed by his use of the box that they decided they really wanted him to succeed and/or come to Vegas.\n\nHOWEVER, that said, iirc they ask if he slides anything into the envelopes.  He very specifically says that he doesn't slide anything "into" the envelope.  This leads me to believe that *every* envelope has both 100 pounds and a fake note and he uses his jokes to misdirect and stall while he slides the 100 pounds "out" of any chosen envelope.  I am not an expert but that's how I would do it.	1309887139

Even if he didn't post a huge number of predictions, there is still quite a high statistical chance that someone will predict an earthquake spot on at some point by random chance when you consider that he is just one of many cranks. The sheer number of predictions thrown out by all cranks, particularly about such an unstable part of the world as Japan, increases the likelihood of one of these guesses being correct dramatically. The analogy I would draw is to the lottery where it is suprising for the individual who wins, but not suprising that an individual won. Coombea is one of a huge number of cranks who throw out these predictions all the time, therefore it is not necessarily strange that one prediction, even one that seems so specific, was correct.	1344983918

Thanks for the info. However, I can't help but think of how misleading this can be for people who don't know about lens/film artefacts.

I love how almost all responses speculate that this is just a self-help program like any other, with several speculating that it probably relies on real cognitive behavioral research. Very skeptical, guys.\n\nOverpriced vitamins, hand-wavy interpretations of graduate student psychology papers, made-up brain types and unnecessary SPECT-scans are the epitome of pseudoscientific snake oil.\n\n This is exactly the kind of thing r/skeptic should be debunking. Instead we have "it's probably helpful and doesn't seem to cost too much" and "I heard something like this once!"	1312132084

&gt;If you aren't able to identify it, yes, that's the exact definition of an Unidentified Flying Object. \n\nBut you are talking about the correct form of U.F.O's, NatGeo is not.

I'd wager that based on the fundamental geometry of looking at an object in the sky at an angle from a curved surface, and the OP's mistaken belief that s/he could estimate the speed of the object because "there was a plane not far from it," it wasn't a 90 degree turn.	1352472828
Yeah - I had acupuncture on a doctor's recommendation - and at no time did I ever believe in any of it.\n\nHowever it was startlingly effective at relaxing me (which was the aim, I was very stressed).  I was absolutely tripping and floating afterwards.  That said, I think it's the whole process of "treatment":  one-on-one attention, a quiet, darkened room to lie down in for an hour, soothing music, that contributes a lot to the process.\n\nIn the last session I also had some special heat lamp thing, and I have to say it was like a skin-orgasm for half an hour.  There may be some science in that, apparently it sends some kind of special waves of heat, I don't know, but I've longed to get one ever since.  Apparently they cost thousands though.	1287470844

&gt; If some couple decide to have a child after a war, how would the probability of it being a boy be related to the war?\n\nSince the male determines the sex of the child, and since sperm motility and function can be affected by the male's hormonal state, it isn't unreasonable to conclude that extreme stress (and the high cortisol levels that follow) may have some effect on sex ratio by directly impact the male's sperm. \n\nThat's what I would guess if it were true.	1356943956

Again, the idea that pain can generally sort of release endorphins that may curb further pain is not evidence in favour of acupuncture.

You are correct in many ways. Everything does happen for a reason. Every-single-tiny-thing...it's mind-boggling. I have noticed an increase in sightings. We can't trust any video, audio, or photo any longer due to CGI and our human effect technology. I agree that some of my stories are concerned with interactions i have had with beings and what I call God or Gods. I just don't want to nor try to extrapolate that I know any answers. If I can remain neutral in this aspect I should be okay, because I'm not a know-it-all you know? so we'll see how far I can get. I have some 40 insane experiences at least.\n\nI will start here with something \n\nWhile at a Chiropractic office I drove and parked normally kind of off to the side facing the beginning width of a strip mall structure. As I was walking from my car to the office I could plainly see the rear of the one-story building, the first office of the strip mall. I plainly observed my Doctor at the time facing away from me in the action of turning his body toward me smoking a cigarette. Now then, a smear of sorts appeared from behind him morphed into a very large black wolf (black dog of hell?) immediately began trotting away from him. The "wolf" from the very beginning of my eye-witness (makes me think of "what the bleep do we know" cartoon of that eye experiment where matter reacts to whether it is being observed or not..anyway more on that subject later). This wolf had made eye contact with me immediately from the time I saw this odd morph. The "Black Wolf" trotted diagonally away from and in between the both of us for app 15 full dog step cycles around a very short concrete wall separating the strip mall from residential and vanished directly within our eyesight (Dr. was now facing me and the wolf.)  I continued walking to the front and waited to be called. Upon asking him, " what was that huge dog all about?" he quickly answered, "what dog?"..."The giant black dog, he was all frizzy, i saw you look at him". He just shrugged. I was confounded as to why he wouldn't admit that he could see this giant black wolf-dog right in front of him. What was this guy into?\n\nBy the way Every single story I have I have pondered all the possibilities so I will come out and give other explanations because I am a realist and have very high perspective. Yes the dog just could have been a real dog and lied down right behind that short fence. But, wow it just really freaked me out. Did i just see a Black Dog of Hell?\n\nanother sighting story later.	1314167785

I'm not sure if you even read my previous reply to you given \n\n&gt;If we don't know what it is, cannot tell how fast it is moving or how far away, then how can we relate similar comparisons?\n\nWas already explained. Do you know a better method to undertake the examination of intangible things other than compare and contrast to similar phenomena? \n\nAlso, you seem to have ignored (or been unaware of) the mass quantity of radar, photographic, and video evidence. From the photographs or videos we take the minority that has perspective to cast shadow, or disturbs the environment in such a way as to be relevant. \n\n&gt;It seems to me that you are less interested in identifying these things - thus realizing they are a plane or bird or whatever - and more interested in categorizing blurry lights in the sky.\n\nThis is a thinly veiled ad hominem, and you come off as quite arrogant to belittle me without addressing the arguments, and instead making assumptions on my character. \n\nI am quite interested in identifying these things, you seem to be confused as to the nature and prevalence of the evidence that purports this is a real phenomena.\n\n&gt;"Here we have the 'slow blue' blurry light category: we see a lot of these mostly on tuesdays. Ah! Now, here we have the fast moving white lights! These are very interesting! We don't know what they are, but we DO know that we are able to categorize them with other similar blurry lights"\n\nAn attempt to derail or [ridicule](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-ridicule.html) the topic does not do the community, or you justice. Be careful not to fall into the pit of confirming your own bias. Claims of aliens and such have no evidence whatsoever, but [that does not imply](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/biased-sample.html) you can ignore on those grounds a phenomena that has been repeatedly proven to be anything but non-existent and explained away as Chinese candles.  \n\nI expect more of this subreddit, both in that this should be a place of discussion based on the rules of logic, and that you should behave with respect towards something you might not have studied, when it is presented respectfully. Have you looked into the issue in depth by the way? Or are you simply appealing to authority in the way that you assume what the commonly held belief is?	1281870650

Christian Science isn't Christian either. At least has about as much in common with Christianity as Mormonism does.

I'd just like to say that the diet of the human is hugely varied from country to country, and the USA's idea of a diet is not the healthiest option.  So what is "wrong" and what is "right" does not seem so black and white as you are putting it.  Additionally, just because our bodies have worked in one particular way for tens of thousands of years does not make it the most efficient or correct way, nor does it mean that the natural desires it creates are the best for it.   Our metabolism, (in my opinion) does not function optimally for the average lifestyle in this country these days.  Many of us no longer need (or want) the degree of fat store that our bodies provide because we're not going to go days or weeks without being able to kill an animal to eat.	1310156406

&gt; I'm considering paying to have an external lab test for any active ingredient.\n\nWhy? They already admit that on the packaging.\n\n&gt; This should essentially prove that they are selling 'water'.\n\nAren't they sugar pills? (That have been sprinkled with the magic water.)\n\n&gt; If I attack one of the big chains I can them bring their reputation into question in that if they are willing to sell this crap what OTHER crap are they selling.\n\nI've mulled this approach over.  Honestly, I don't see it having that big of an impact on a Whole Foods in San Francisco.\n\nCVS which is actually a pharmacy sounds like a more ripe target as people are actually looking for medicine. Not only that but CVS makes their own store brand of that along with the label "recommended by CVS pharmacists".  I think we could do some significant PR damage by exposing how untrustworthy CVS pharmacists are based on the packaging of their own products.	1333984376

The first one I can think of was when I woke up, but I could still hear my dream. I don't remember the dream very much since it happened when I was about 6, but it involved the evil Krusty doll from The Simpsons. I remember waking up and it was morning, I suddenly heard, clear as day, the famous evil Krusty doll laugh and "I'm going to kill you" I screamed and ran into my parents room.\n\nThe next one is creepy because I didn't know it could happen, and trust me, I'm definitely not bullshitting. I was walking into the kitchen one day and overheard my older brother (he's four and a half years older than me) talking to my mum about a dream he had, and it seemed all too familiar.. I cut him off by saying "And it started unravelling the bandages from its face?" my brother stared at me slightly unnerved and went on to say "Then I saw its alien face.. It had fangs" I cut him off again just as unnerved "And it lunged for you and woke up?" Turns out me and my brother had the exact same dream on the same night.\n\nAt first I put my first and only (so far) sleep paralysis experience down as paranormal, but the more I thought about it, it made sense that it was sleep paralysis. I remember turning my laptop off at about 4am and I laid in bed. I was laying there awake (well, what I thought I was doing) and I suddenly envisioned 2 hands with leather gloves rap around my neck and squeezed. I was instantly paralysed (minus my head since I was able to turn it) and felt the air drain from me. I tried so hard to scream out but nothing would come out. After what seemed like forever, the grip disappeared from my neck, I quickly got my breath back and went to scream out to my mum, only to have the sensation back on my neck, muting my cries. Again what seemed like ages of fighting to move and breath, I managed to splurt out "stop" and with that, it went away.. It felt as if it never happened. 	1350764100

I really doubt most alien abduction stories, even as I'm increasingly convinced that contact has been made. Too many sensational, attention-whory stories over the decades.\n\nAlso, this topic made me think of the opening of the X-Files episode *Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'* where a couple of Air Force pilots in-costume as grays are interrupted mid-faked-abduction by a third alien ("Lord Kinbote")	1316292744

&gt; My issue with the mid-air collision between two airplanes is where is your other missing plane and pilot? I've never read that they were looking for another missing plane in that area. Do you have any candidates?\n\nIf the other plane was not flying under a registered flight plan, they wouldn't know to be looking for another plane, they would have no idea that the plane existed.  They wouldn't be looking anywhere else since the two planes would likely crash near each other in the water.  They wouldn't need to be looking for any specific plane, just any sign of any plane.  No flight plan, transponder turned off (which means it doesn't show up on radar), this is the modus operandi of a smuggler, of which there were many flying in and out of asia in to australia in the 70's.  We didn't find one plane, you shouldn't be surprised they didn't find the other.\n\nIf you are looking for the other plane, then read the transcription, he mentions it many times.  He just can't figure out what the hell he's looking at because he has no experience with such things, and has no qualms about trying to get closer to get a better look (because he's an idiot).	1327332587
Michael Shermer's *[Why People Believe Weird Things](http://www.michaelshermer.com/weird-things/)*.  As a skeptic, I'm often frustrated by how easily people believe things that seem bizarre to me, and this book helped explain why this is.\n\nThe TL;DR is that people believe woo mostly because they *want* to, but the book goes into the psychological and sociological reasons behind this.	1292138810

My favourite comment on the article:\n\n""...more work needs to be done to bring those anomalies into the accepted paradigm."\n\nThis statement shows willingness to learn more, however it also indicates that it's author is willing to learn more only if what is learned can be brought into "the accepted paradigm." This sort of mentality is the bane of scientific progress. I imagine this is the sort of mentality Gallileo had to contend with before producing one of the greatest paradigm shifts of all time.\n\nI suggest that a less biased author would have left room for the possibility of a paradigm shift, given, of course, the supporting evidence.\n\nI am not a "UFO" proponent by any means, but I am a proponent of adjusting our paradigms based on evidence, and not vice versa."	1315064759

I love this one:\n\n&gt;I agree, those foods do help if they are indeed organic and not poisoned with agricultural chemicals (sprays, pesticides, herbicides, etc.). Last week I bought some expensive frozen berries from a respected grocery chain. Soon after having my berry smoothies, I got headaches. Finally figured out that the berries were linked to my headaches. Most likely due to a reaction to the toxins the berries were sprayed with. I do hope the study used truly organic food.\n\nCan't tell if it's meant as a joke or if it's a severe case of brain freeze.	1353111359

&gt; Monsanto on the other hand is in the business of patented seeds. It's illegal to save their seeds for replanting. You cannot adapt their seeds to your corner of the world. If they are not suited to your fields, Monsanto will sell you pesticides and fertilizers instead of letting you adapt the seeds yourself. This goes against the basic premise of growing food and does not help the world, only helps Monsanto.\n\nIllegal in what sense, though? Illegal in the sense that it's a breach of the contract you signed with Monsanto? If that's the case then that is perfectly acceptable.\nIllegal in the sense that it's a criminal act? Then lobby your government, that's unacceptable and should not be a crime at all.	1326362928

&gt;The fact that you have "proven" that the fire was really really cold and really really hot demonstrates the nonsensical illogical nature of your position.\n\nDo you really have that much trouble with reading comprehension?\n\nThe fires were cool, as most of the fule burned away within seconds.

I think many of these alternative methods have at least something that works for them. So of course, if some of the Ayurvedic treatments have merit, adopt them, discard the rest.

Osteopathic physicians probably shouldn't be on the list, at least if they are from the United States or any other country that trains and regulates them similar to medical doctors. [In the 21st century, the training of osteopathic physicians in the United States is very similar to that of their MD counterparts.  Osteopathic physicians attend 4 years of medical school followed by at least 3 years of residency. They use all conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment. Though still trained in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM), the modern derivative of Still's techniques, a minority of osteopathic physicians use it in actual practice.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathic_medicine_in_the_United_States)	1326124916

Did you read the original paper before holding forth with this opinion?  It has nothing to do with emails being "badly written".\n\nThe paper asks the question, "Why do scammers claim they are from Nigeria when virtually everyone knows that Nigerian financial propositions are scams?"\n\nThe answer is to garner responses only from the most gullible.\n\nHere's [the paper](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/167719/WhyFromNigeria.pdf). Here are a couple of paragraphs:\n\n&gt; An examination of a web-site that catalogs scam emails\n&gt;shows that 51% mention Nigeria as the source of funds\n&gt;[1], with a further 34% mentioning Cˆote d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal or some other West African\n&gt;country (see Figure 7). This ﬁnding is certainly supported by an analysis of the mail of this genre received\n&gt;by the author.\n&gt;\n&gt;Why so little imagination? Why don’t Nigerian scammers claim to be from Turkey, or Portugal or Switzerland or New Jersey? Stupidity is an unsatisfactory answer: the scam requires skill in manipulation, considerable inventiveness and mastery of a language that is\n&gt;non-native for a majority of Nigerians. It would seem\n&gt;odd that after lying about his gender, stolen millions,\n&gt;corrupt oﬃcials, wicked in-laws, near-death escapes and\n&gt;secret safety deposit boxes that it would fail to occur\n&gt;to the scammer to lie also about his location. That the\n&gt;collection point for the money is constrained to be in\n&gt;Nigeria doesn’t seem a plausible reason either. If the\n&gt;scam goes well, and the user is willing to send money, a\n&gt;collection point outside of Nigeria is surely not a problem if the amount is large enough.\n&gt;\n	1340337861

If you don't mind me being cold and analytical about it, I'd say there are moderate number of teenage girls that write journals filled with depressed poetry, etc. I'd just mark it up to coincidence that one happened to die in  the large timeframe ("This will be my last year, Lord. I have gotten what I can. Thank you.") she set for herself.\n\nI don't think there is any evidence of this, but it may also be possible that if she thought it was her purpose to die young, and she sees someone with a gun in front of her, she may have put herself into harm's way.\n\nBut like I said, that's hypothetical.	1317264276

So you make around $200K-300K?  Well, first of all, that's good.  Good for you.  Cool (no sarcasm).\n\nSecondly, however, I'll say that 1) having money isn't the only way to make the world a better place.  Matter of fact, it seems money is actually one of the THE main reasons that the world has turned into the shit hole that it is.  Therefore....\n\nWait a minute . . . I just re-read what you wrote, and realized how *extremely* ambiguous I'm finding it . . . There are various different ways to take it.\n\nOne way seems to have to involve a vote of support for the Thrive documentary.  The guy is obviously definitely rich.  However, it DOES seem (at least to some people) that he's trying to use his money to make the world a better place . . . So that's a good thing, right?  Right.\n\nOf course your second sentence can be what is payed more attention to and the Thrive guy can be interpreted as being one of the rich that are trying to "keep it all to themselves", if you will.\n\nNot quite sure how to take what you wrote, therefore.\n\nEither way, I still stand behind what I said.  This doc seems to bring up some valid points, and I thought it was a decent film.\n\nPersonally, however, I REALLY like the docs made on [Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project](http://www.thevenusproject.com/).  That cat right there seems to have a good idea about how to do things.\n\nOf course his ideas will likely *never* come to pass on this planet - currently the human race is far, far too remedial and primitive - but they are great, forward-thinking ideas he has.  I think Foster Gamble and Jacque Fresco's ideas could coexists decently.	1338572776
&gt; DoctorYuyi possibly trying to cover up the fact that he faked the letter, and the SeceretSanta moderators possibly trying to cover up the fact that they acted with too much haste on a possibly fake letter without questioning the accused person.\n\nOccam's razor would indicate that this explanation is less likely than a more simple explanation, unless there is some evidence to back it up. As of right now, there is no such evidence, but rather only speculation. The simplest explanation is the same which the evidence currently indicates, namely that Yuyi did indeed receive the hateful missive, and as such is the most reasonable opinion to hold on this subject.\n\nA conspiracy such as this is also somewhat questionable by examining the character of the Moderators. At a cost of much time and effort, and perhaps monetary investment as well  (for what ostensibly appears an altruistic purpose), it is doubtful that the Moderators would then choose to 'cover up' an error of theirs instead of taking full responsibility and taking steps to correct a mistake.	1323026194

I have only had dreams a few times, not a lot, mostly just feelings.  I don't have to touch someone, or even see them, I can feel what is up even if they are behind me.  I think that's why my house felt haunted when I was little, I could feel their energy and didn't know what to think of it.  Every place is haunted.  That was especially bad, but I learned to trust my feelings.  I have some serious intuition, like leaving an area right before something bad happens there or deciding last second not to go based on a feeling and later see something bad happened there.  I lost my mother, too, and she felt things like I do.  The night before she died, we laid awake all night, she in her bed and I in mine, talking through our hallway about what she wanted for me and my brother if anything happened to her.  It was like we both knew, but nobody said it, we just talked as if we knew we wouldn't get to talk again.  There is a lot more than this as well, getting late here, but pm me and we will chat more tomorrow.

You can have the best of both world by implementing sensible midwife-assisted procedures in state-of-the-art hospitals. Imagine a birthing house next to an ICU. That's where I'd want to go.\n\nNow THAT, my friend, is a reasonable conclusion based on scientific evidence that appeases both "sides" of this debate to the highest degree possible.

I think what "burnoutelite" is saying so eloquently is that you had sleep paralysis or maybe more directly a dream. When you were able to move the "apparition" went away (or perhaps you were more awake and thus the dreaming stopped.\n\nMost people don't hallucinate from just one late night but that's not to say you can't especially if you're under emotional stress and you're trying to sleep.	1324897966
The fundamental problem is climate change theory is that there isn't "enough" data to compare to.  Though we have solid sunlight evidence going back to the early Soviet era (we're blocking out the sun over the last 100 years), that's still nowhere near far back enough.  30 years of climate change data doesn't even amount to a blip of relevant data.\n\nThis is especially true with green house gases.  We thought the ozone hole in the polar regions would swallow the earth whole, but instead shrank back down completely contradicting the greenhouse gas hypothesis.  This has been the story of virtually all attempts to predict climate change.\n\nThat's the real inconvenient truth.  It's much like UFOlogy, the data is there, but not the verification of the hypothesis.  So **even if it's real**, we just don't have the smoking gun.\n\nFurther complicating matters, there are very rich companies that spend a lot of real money spewing nonsense for political clout.  So when people read that shit, they overreact.  It's very strange that a person like Plait doesn't acknowledge that possibility.  	1354578363

Nobody here is advocating accepting Kurzweil's speculations as gospel truth.  This is /r/skeptic after all.  But dreamers like him are extremely useful in pushing us all to imagine what *could be* in the near (or distant) future, and inspire people to work towards a better world.

coast to coast is awesome awesomeness!!! True, its much better when there are serious scientists and experts on as guests for the actual information and a nice dose of reality. But the other shows with crazy bastards ranting about doomsday, lizard people, nazis on the moon, ghosts hauntings and other wacky topics is just good ol' fun... &amp; there's the slim possibility that these conspiracy theories are somewhat true, Which is horrifying.	1330681680

The Avro Car was a Canadian project.  Avro was a Canadian company most famous for the Avro Arrow.. which the USA made them destroy because it was better than their planes.

Ahh, yes.  I neglected to account for [succussion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succussion#Preparation), the ten hard shakes required to activate the vital essences of the preparations.

norway still has an income gap, albeit smaller than other countries, it still operates by capitalist motives; profit over sustainability, ethics, employment and so on. the government attempts to hold the negatives in check by various institutions and regulation, but this is really just  treating the symptoms. \n\nyou are stuck in your capitalist/monetary paradigm, where you need to make money to survive, and all "ideal" structures like research, higher education and so on are funded through taxation. you really need to read up on _alternative_ economic systems, and not expect explanations of how another system would function, using mechanisms and patterns from the current system.\n\ni would read up on syndicalism, participatory economics or even the gift economy if you really are interested.	1287563971

I have this theory that the U.s. media can be used to interpret events. Take, back when Bush was doing his shit, 24 came out, Jack Bower, the man who had to torture to save America, go to any extremes, and teach us terrorists are scary. Recently, V came out, so if you have ever seen it you'll probably get it when I say I think the government is either trying to soften us up to the idea we are not alone, or to get us defensive about aliens. So far the aliens in V are pricks of the highest degree, so make your own judgment.\n\n\\rant	1261191231

I don't think I ever said anyone made a "Beeline" to earth. Also I understand that you are using your "Unlikely" and "Impossible" to hedge your bet.  Its like being pregnant they exist or they don't.\n\n  If they exist there is more then 1 race of aliens.  If there is more then one alien race then the chance of discovery of this planet is more and more "likely" by one of them.\n\n  Also I think at this point I should point back to one of your original points.  "I find it far more likely that we're seeing misidentified terrestrial craft, weather phenomena, products of imagination and top-secret military craft." This is a line that ET critics have parroted over and over.  Here is what most of them "fail to grasp".  Us "ET enthusiasts" will admit that 95% or so of all ufo sightings are military or terrestrial crafts or some explainable phenomenon.  Its that 5% that even project Blue Book could not explain away that intrigue me. Out of those 5% it only takes 1 to be real for us not to be alone.\n\n  The nice part about this is in my lifetime (most likely by 2017) we will know the truth one way or the other.	1240773444
&gt; A lot of comments with very clear antisemite agendas are getting loads of upvotes.\n\nOK.  I thought you had inferred that the original claim was antisemitic.  My point still stands.

I saw one of those as a kid where the output (in that case a pipe coming from a box) was supported by four thin wires (as well as the pipe, superstitiously) which I thought was even cooler. I had to eventually ask (after about an hour of thinking about it). I've seen several, but the ones with the whole device floating seem wrong to me - there's an instant hint that something is totally amiss here (giant blue faucets do not hang in the air like that). It looks cooler if the device looks stable, but mysteriously produces infinite water.	1356797336
You think fractures are all like the one you shown above? The vast majority of breaks show no displacement, and can only be identified by small dark lines where the break is. However, as with a lot of x-rays, there are dark lines in a number of places for a number of reasons, so incorrect diagnosis of fractures (either false positives or false negatives) happen fairly regularly. Sometimes the x-ray is inconclusive, and the person will be sent home to see how the injury progresses, and if symptoms persist they do the x-ray again to see if it's any clearer.\n\n	1348285722

&gt; If we have an observation that contradicts a theory, we can safely invalidate the theory without having a new one.\n\nWhen data seems to invalidate old theories, there are multiple possible explanations, including a wide variety of problems with the data. That is why people are *more* skeptical of studies which violate our current understanding of science than those which agree with our current understanding; the odds of an error which creates disagreement are, in general, much higher than the odds of an error creating consilience. Which was the original point of the comment thread.\n\nHowever, even if it is confirmed that the aberrant data is correct, that doesn't mean we just throw out the old theory. We look for modifications which would incorporate the new information, and even if we don't have those, we continue to use the old theory in many cases until we have something better. We might do so with the caveat that we know of at least one problem with the current theory, but it was the current theory because it was a highly successful explanatory framework. Science doesn't just stop and wait until someone comes up with a replacement (although you can be damn sure people will be working furiously on such replacements).	1346945636
I have never personally demonstrated that gravity on earth is roughly 9.8 m/s^2 as I assume you also have not. I have also never observed the cracking of an atom, that doesn't mean they can't be cracked. I assume you believe many things you have not personally verified, but with evidence it is right for you to have accepted them.\n\nSkepticism is about not accepting a story *without evidence*. Denying anything you haven't personally experienced regardless of gathered evidence is not skepticism it is denialism.	1343462705

I'm not sure exactly what responses you were looking for, but I would just like to say that it has been long-established that vegetarian diets are *at least* just as healthy as omnivorous ones, and when compared to *regular* meat-eaters, usually more healthy.  He linked to a couple studies, but a simple google search will yield plenty of others.  \n\nI guess my real question is, what actually led you to *your* belief?  His post was full of links, but yours was basically nothing more than the naturalistic fallacy.  I mean seriously, what about "we have fists, therefore we need to punch people"?  The existence of an ability *in no way* implies the existence of a necessity.\n\nTo date, I haven't really seen any studies which conclude that a properly-balanced vegetarian diet is unhealthy, so do you have any that you were basing your previous stance on?	1294006521

Short answer, no this is not proof of Extra-Terrestrials. Its only proof of strange things in the sky.  I'm not a skeptic, but the level of proof is clear, the level of proof the planet Earth will need will be an encounter of the 3rd kind we all witness. \n	1352407889

&gt;No, that's not what it implies at all. It implies that they have a recent human female ancestor who apparently didn't contribute much to nuclear DNA. Something that shared a common ancestor with humans in the distant past would not produce these results.\n\nThis is nonsense. Any ancestor to humans would certainly result in some portion of "human" DNA if tested as they would have much the same genome. Anything primate that shared a recent common ancestor or was a recent ancestor would result with some "human" DNA. There's no reason why it wouldn't.\n\nI don't think you understand what we're testing for, we ARE testing for "humans", the results *should be* "human"; there is no confusion here. They're just a different kind of "human" with slightly different DNA than homo sapiens, which should entirely explains the overall differences in the DNA, because they are different, but not damn very.	1354414317
&gt;Noone is claiming it's a huge problem, but Dawkins is arguing that this problem and all problems like it aren't allowed to be annoying or frustrating.\n\nThis is being cited as an example of sexism and misogyny in the skeptic movement by Watson herself, and her most vocal supporters.\n\n&gt;I expect more than a backpedaling from Dawkins after he used a fallacy he himself has bashed opponents for.\n\nWhat he said is only a logical fallacy if you're using it as the backbone of an argument and not as a blown-up example to illustrate your point. There is a colossal difference between saying "They have it worse than you, thus in conclusion your concerns are irrelevant" and using the example of muslim women being mutilated as a contrast to an awkward elevator ride. \n\nDawkins then responded to criticism by agreeing that his example was misleading and that what he wanted to get across was that an awkward elevator ride was not even an issue to begin with, and that people had misinterpreted the focus of his post.\n\n&gt;Since the situation is different for men, a man shouldn't get the same sympathy.\n\nHow come? Can a man not feel uncomfortable in this situation? Is a man's discomfort not worth the same sympathy? Rebecca is trying to make this into an issue of sexism but it just does not apply in this case.\n\n&gt;The sexism in the skeptic movement is clearly shown by the rape threats Rebecca receives and how people want to decide how she should feel and what boundaries she should have.\n\nThen why isn't the focus on rape threats? I can clearly and wholeheartedly get behind fighting that.\n\nWith regard to the latter part of your ending statement, how are people trying to decide how she should feel and what boundaries she should have? Who exactly is trying to set boundaries for her? As part of a free society she can do whatever the hell she wants but if she says something stupid she'll get called on it just like everyone else, including Dawkins for not chilling out a bit before writing his response.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf we talk about what happened, what was it that was so bad? What happened that was even objectionable?\n\nBy her own description, events occured as follows: She's leaving the conference late at night and upon reaching the elevator a guy that had exited the conference at the same time strikes up a conversation with her. His first line is "Hey, don't take this the wrong way but I think you're very interesting" and he then asks her if she wants to have coffee at his place. She says no. Rebecca then exits the elevator at her floor.\n\nAssuming there isn't an unstated plot twist including a chainsaw, is this really something worth complaining about? It would be nice to avoid an awkward elevator ride, but what exactly do you hope to accomplish by making an issue out of it? Would it be better if he had run to catch up with her in the corridor and asked there? Should he have asked while she was on stage? Should he sit down, realise that she is better than him and at the very least work on his abs before he tries to proposition a woman again?\n\nThe last part is obviously in exaggeration, but really, what should he do? What if you're a guy that genuinely likes a woman and this is the only chance you've got without actually being creepy and stalking her. He took the chance and asked her out and got rejected. That's that. Remember that there is zero opposition to a woman doing the same thing, which is the only part of this that has a connection to sexism.\n\nIt's also worth noting that had she found him attractive they would have gone up, maybe had sex, and we would never have never have heard about it.	1310065905
Well, the question is "how much money do you have"?\n\nThe pro Nikons and Canons are excellent at low light. The D3s and D4 are fantastic, but you're talking about five to 6 thousand dollars.\nI'll be picking up a D4 soon so, I'll let you know how it works.\n\nIf you want to add night vision to a working DSLR or video camera, you're talking 6 - 7 thousand dollars alone for a gen 3 extension tube.\nFrom what I remember, there are two models, one with adjustable gain and one without and adaptors for many pro cameras.\n\nhttp://www.nightvisioncameras.com/nv-products.html\n\nhttp://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/399153-REG/AstroScope_9350_NIKS_3PRO_Night_Vision_Adapter_9350_NIKS_3PRO.html\nhttp://www.adorama.com/SOF914658.html\n\nKeep in mind that you'll also need great lenses. I use a Nikon 200 - 400 mm VR I, which cost 6200 dollars. The new models are close to 7000 bucks after taxes.\n\nhttp://www.adorama.com/NK2004002U.html\n\nOn a pro DSLR or video camera, a 400 mm lens is equal to 8x zoom. Using a teleconverter is not ideal.\n\nWhile a fixed (prime) lens is best with regards to quality and price, being able to zoom is very useful unless you want to set up a two camera system with different lenses.\n\nOther options are to adapt the video camera/DSLR to a spotting scope or a telescope like the Celestron C-6.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVB67azxBZg\n\nThis one sold for about 950 bucks.\n\nhttp://www.astromart.com/classifieds/details.asp?classified_id=598525\n\nThey normally go for a bit more.\n\nhttp://www.celestron.com/astronomy/specials/cpc-telescope-sale.html\n\nOf course if you subscribe to http://reddit.com/r/DIY and have more time and talent than money, you can make your own telescope, which I think bears investigation.\n\nOf course, you'll need a solid tripod when zoomed in as any small motion (like your pulse) is strongly magnified when zoomed in 8x.\nFor my DSLRs, I use a Gitzo carbon fiber tripod, model 3531.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Gitzo-GT3531LSV-Series-Section-Systematic/dp/B0019R1HYG\n\nFor a camera mount on top of the tripod, a ball head just lets the camera flop over and is a bad idea.\n\nI use a Wimberley head (gimbal head) instead, which allows the camera to pivot easily while staying balanced.\n\nhttp://www.tripodhead.com/products/wimberley-main.cfm\n\nhttp://www.adorama.com/WIWH200.html\n\nItems like Calumet's version of the Wimberley head are cost effective, as a Wimberley will cost up to 700 bucks with a mounting plate for the lens.\n\nhttp://www.calumetphoto.com/eng/product/calumet_large_lens_gimbal_head/ck7075\n\nOther options are to use a spotting scope with a DSLR. That is called Digiscoping.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cnm7Eghri8\n\nhttp://www.betterviewdesired.com/Nikon-Fieldscope-III-ED.php\n\nhttp://www.optics4birding.com/nikon-fieldscope-82ed-scope-review.aspx\n\nBut the pro "fieldscope" ultra telephoto lenses are not cheap and offer crazy zooms that may be too much. Prices go from 5500.00 on down. When you are zoomed in that much if you are shooting video, vibration reduction is a must.\n\nhttp://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ns=p_PRICE_2%7c1&amp;ci=1032&amp;N=4083534116&amp;srtclk=sort\n\nhttp://www.dpreview.com/news/2012/11/23/nikon-announces-digiscoping-adapters-for-1-system\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Fieldscope-20-60x60mm-Straight-Spotting/dp/B000QRZUZC\n\nhttp://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/610414-REG/Nikon_8290_Fieldscope_65mm_EDG_2_6_65mm.html\n\nhttp://www.nikon.com/products/sportoptics/lineup/scopes/index.htm\n\nFYI, here is a shot taken of the moon from my backyard in Texas using the following equipment:\n\n    Nikon D3x (screw that, the D800 is much better a camera and 1/2 the price now)\n    Nikon 200 - 400 VR I lens\n    Nikon 2.0 Gen II Teleconverter (adds to the fuzzyness of the image, reduces sharpness)\n    Gitzo 3531 carbon fiber tripod\n    Wimberley gimbal head WH-200 Wimberley Head Version II \n    Remote shutter cable\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MRcxO.jpg\n\nThis image was taken from a 6000 x 4000 original, scaled and sharpened.\n\nMost of the gear I have detailed (minus the tripod and head) is in the image below:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gs5lZ.jpg\n\n	1356649238

I did the "Lights Out" tour last year. It was incredible!  You are given a souvenir flashlight at the beginning of the tour, and it is pitch black in a lot of the rooms. The only downside was when you were in rooms that had walls that faced outside, you could hear all of the noise from the local radio station that was there, the other guests milling around waiting for their tour, and the ambient screams and spooky noises coming from the haunted maze out in the gardens.\n\nWe took the typical tour, but we were given a bit of freedom in poking around while the tour guide was doing her spiel. Mrs. Winchester's bedroom was creepy, but not in a paranormal way, just spooky in the dark. I walked into a cold spot in the ballroom, enough to give me goosebumps on my arm. My friend, a skeptic, noticed them, but then they were gone. That's the only thing that I considered odd.\n\nI would definitely suggest to do the "Lights Out" tour if you are ever in San Jose in October.  Definitely worth it!	1349578003

Sarcasm doesn't always have a place I suppose, but none of these are that hard to disprove and are brought up elsewhere. The ones that are correct (such as "bacon isn't that good for you" or "fast food isn't healthy") are true for different reasons than stated.\n\nSlightly off topic:\n&gt; [8] Amanitas mushroom several reports describing pleasant taste\n\nseems highly surprising. They taste somewhat bitter, mostly like most poisonous mushrooms. I could, of course, be slightly biased as my mom picks mushrooms a lot and would show me how to chew and spit a small amount of hard to tell cases to see if it's an eatable one or one I need to make sure I don't eat, thus making me associate a taste something like this with "this is poisonous" when I later ate appropriate amounts recreationally. But really, I have a hard time seeing very many people taking a bite of it and not going "eww..".\n\nSome other tastes are pure bugs, something like lead salts or ethylene glycol shouldn't taste sweet but it randomly does. Some that aren't toxic are exploited as artificial sweeteners - you're body is misjudging it as containing simple carbs even though it really does not (or at least not any you can digest). Some others are a matter of a change in conditions - bacon or a big mac tastes good because they are packed with easy to digest nutrition but in the industrialized world the main problem isn't snarfing down enough calories as much as avoiding snarfing down too much.	1326742797

You didn't ask me for ethical criteria.  Not sure what fiber and calorie counting has to do with anything.  Our bodies require protein, fat, and carbohydrates - the three macronutrients.  I simply eat the foods that provide these nutrients most effectively, the first two are covered quite well with meat and animal products.	1299470612
That quote comes from a 1978 study. More recent results have indicated that calorie restriction reduces blood glucose, not a keto diet. [This article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxyhost.library.tmc.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1157.2000.tb00275.x/abstract) has a good discussion on it, which I've pasted below if you can't access the pdf. Other than that, I was only parroting what I'd heard in medical school, so I'd be happy for you to show me where I'm wrong.\n\n&gt;Because the KD-induced elevation of ketone bodies mimics the effects of starvation, it has been proposed that the KD could also influence glucose metabolism as occurs in starvation (7,41). However, the results from several studies have not been consistent. For cxamplc,\nDeVivo et al. (36) reported a reduction of blood glucose levels in rats, whereas Al-Mudallal et al. (42) found no effects of the KD on the blood glucose levels in rats. Furthermore, only small or no changes in blood glucose levels have been reported for humans on the KD (37,43,44). To address this issue Curther, we measured the plasma glucose levels in EL mice treated with the KD. As in the Al-Mudallal et al. (42) studies, we found that Lhe KD does not reduce the blood glucose levels in EL mice despite the lack of carbohydrates in the diet. Normal glucose levels, however, do not exclude changes in brain energy metabolism caused by ketosis. For example, increased levels of @-OHB reduce glucose oxidation, whereas increased glucose enhances ketone body oxidation in the rat brain (26). Glucose also has a pcrmissive\neffect on lipid biosynthesis from ketone bodies in the brain (26). These studies suggest that a normal level of glucose is necessary for ketone body utilization in the brain. 	1334330489

&gt;Outcrossing. This is "the movement of genes from GM plants into conventional crops," and this really can happen - they're the same species, so they can interbreed. But it's only a concern if GM plants are harmful, which they're not.\n\nIt's an actual, real concern if a farmer gets sued by Monsanto for growing their patented strain of corn after it started growing in his crop due to cross-pollination with a nearby field.\n\nThe author hasn't exactly presented a comprehensive argument that GM crops aren't harmful, either. I haven't ever seen any evidence that they actually *are* harmful, but he's still using his assumptions as evidence.	1292209477
I think the popular (that is... unpaid) position against human-caused global climate change is that:   \n1) The government uses climate change panic, like fear of terrorism, to pass oppressive regulations.  \n2) Just like critics of the war on terror poke holes in claims of fearmongers, critics of climate change feel that they are breaking down an overblown (or completely fabricated) threat in order to subvert oppression based on that threat.\n\nThe part I don't understand is how environmental protection regulation constitutes "oppression" or "big government".    	1332266352

I didn't edit it, I deleted it, because another commenter said he downvoted me for "disregarding what he said."  I didn't feel the need  to continue my discourse with him/her, so I deleted ALL of my comment replies to them, not just those.  That doesn't imply anything.  I routinely delete comments on many topics.  I don't see what that implies.\n\n It is a legitimate question.  You don't know what a logical fallacy is.  If you did, you'd not commit the fallacy of poisoning the wells, which attempts to discredit any and all arguments due to the source, such as you did here.  I didn't commit any.\n\n&gt;If you weren't a skeptic who was allergic to bullshit, you wouldn't have edited everything to cover it up your complete lack of neutrality.\n\nI think I got what you meant, although, if you knew how to write, you'd have said "If you WERE a skeptic..." instead of agreeing with me.\n\nI believe he is fake.  It is my opinion, to which I am entitled.  It doesn't say that in the post topic though.  It just asks a question that many accredited sources, such as Huffington Post and many others, have proposed.  Your bias is showing.

Hope this doesn't come off as preachy, but I had HORRIBLE back problems.  My father has struggled with them too.

&gt;See, by saying these things you are also saying that you believe that children are not the responsibility of their parents, but are instead wards of the state.\n\nIt's a bit more nuanced than that. I believe they are the responsibility of their parents until their parents become irresponsible toward them, at which point the state should step in.\n\n&gt;when saying that vaccination should not be a choice.\n\nWho has said that? Vaccination should be a choice. But choices have consequences. People get confused about this aspect of rights - Having the right to do something does not absolve you from all consequences of doing it. People have the right to march down the street screaming that they hate black people, but they do not have the right to be free from the consequences of that. They do not get to say "No one is allowed to judge me because I have the right to freedom of speech," and if a business owner or a private homeowner wishes to bar them from their property as a result of their hate speech, they do not get to say "But I have the right to say it, and therefore you have to let me in."\n\nSimilarly, people do have the right to choose not to vaccinate their kids, but they do not have the right to be free from the consequences thereof. One of those consequences is that the kid does not get to go to public school and put the other children at risk.\n\nAnother thing people are foggy about regarding rights is that my rights do not trump your rights. I do not get to trespass on your property and violate your right to exercise control over your property merely because I am carrying a political sign. My right to free speech does not trump your right to property.\n\nAgain, this is not about rights, and it is not about whether or not the anti-vaxxer's kid gets sick - it is about whether or not the anti-vaxxer has the right to get OTHER peoples' kids sick because he refuses to take basic precautionary measures - or, the anti-vaxxer's right to refuse to immunize his kid does not trump my right to send my kid to school without worrying about him getting rubella or mumps.  \n\nActions have consequences, and nothing in the Constitution says anything about our rights being immune from them.\n\n	1349753974

&gt; Plant safety is based on actual calculations \n\nNo, it is not possible to evaluate cross relations between components, the failures of the components, or even a non-negligible fraction of possible scenarios. That is simply not doable. The issue has been discussed to great length by Richard Feynman, in relation to the Space Shuttle; the analysis applies to the methodology in general. http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt\n\nFurthermore, externally it is much more effective not to look at the process itself but to check whenever the decisions - with all the alleged checks - are even sane. Consider sintered aluminium-boron plates under water, http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr0933/sec3/196.html . Water seeps in, hydrogen is produced by reaction between water and aluminium, plates bloat up, the boron inside redistributes, etc etc. A very, very predictable consequence of usage of a highly reactive metal in a porous form under water. Has it been caught by the 'calculations' and the 'review process'? No. You need smart people to act in good faith to stop insane ideas of this kind. Same goes for Fukushima and placement of the generators and switchgear in the basement. This did also meet the original safety requirements even though it was less safe than the alternatives.\n\nWith regards to the contents of spent fuel pool, the racks have been modified for denser placement of the spent fuel rods, the increase in density raises the specific heat output, and the ultimate temperature reached by the fuel in the event of loss of water (which can happen due to external factors that are not part of PRA). It is rather annoying that I have to describe in the detail the issues on which you claim broad and supreme expertise.\n\nUltimately, the problem is not technological. The problem is with human factor. The problem is with overconfidence. The problem is with management that does not understand the limits of the methods or even what's conceivably doable, as to believe in things like "We PROVE that our systems, structures, and components, meet their design criteria", or to overstate it's relation to actual safety. Yes, the Fukushima plant was "proven" (for sufficiently small values of "proof") to meet it's design criteria. The design criteria were grossly inadequate.	1355563686

I wish I still had the energy. I've been interested in the subject since 2002 or so, and I've researched it as much as is humanly possibly. I find that most people have absolutely no idea about the facts of that day, no grasp of basic physics, no knowledge of the ways in which the military industrial complex operates, and no concept of just how badly the investigation (if you can even call it that) was botched. The Popular Mechanics article is 11 pages long. It's pretty much a fluff piece, and it was utterly decimated by David Ray Griffin's 392 page book which actually has sources and facts in it. I even tried to read the later Popular Mechanics book on the same subject, but compared to Griffin's book it reads like a fairy tale geared toward 4th graders. It's a pathetic little tome in a big typeface. It's full of the worst sort of logical errors. I'm shocked that a subreddit called r/skepicism has so little skepticism about the official story of 9/11. I tend to think that one can only believe the official story when one considers a very limited range of evidence. When you take all the evidence available into account, the official story looks like a pretty messy turd. A couple of decades ago the neo-cons decided they had enough power to start manufacturing reality. It turns out they were right! We'll forget about all the evidence to the contrary eventually. 	1304537664

If good exists on their plane so does evil, and it's likely that the evil ones would attempt to hijack and dis-inform anyone who would be a recipient to their influence. Be wary and approach it all with skepticism and file it into the box of "maybe, could be, who knows, eventually."	1343810371

I myself can't even remember when to use whom, so I just stick with who which is considered fine in modern English.\n\nSpeaking of applying rules that don't exist in the English language, that stupid rule that pseudo-intellectuals spout about not ending a sentence with a preposition is actually a rule of grammar taken from the Latin language, it has nothing to do with English at all, and was if I remember correctly something which upper class people did in an attempt to differentiate who they spoke from the lower classes.	1290840964

Gotta love trick questions.\n\nIt was stated in a vague way.

**TL;DR1: It's dangerous and the implications of it being true are far more disturbing than it being false or misleading (to the point of equivocation). I'd be happy to discuss that if you like.**\n\nI don't doubt her experience or her struggle. \n\nOne thing I don't doubt, but it seems important to make a note of: \n\nHer description of her doctor was one of long-standing relationship and frequent enough contact for recognition, yet her cancer was believed to be 6 years progressed. To have any kind of serious cancer progress that far without symptoms is a claim worth investigating unto itself. \n\nMargarita Murphy MD documented member of ASCRS -- http://www.fascrs.org/files/ASCRSNewsFall06.pdf\n\nCV - http://www.colonsurgeonsofcharleston.com/uploads/MMurphyCV1-8-2012_doc.pdf associated with [this picture](http://www.colonsurgeonsofcharleston.com/uploads/_mg_10033.jpg) on [this site](http://www.colonsurgeonsofcharleston.com/staff.php)\n\nThat's usually a lot more I can find on most people, so at least it's not a misrepresentation thing. \n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2780171/ - Refers to FASCRS as a good resource. Papers and conventions are long standing and referenced across other reputable sites.\n\n---\n\nI find the part what Dr. Murphy accounts her reasoning for urging her to go to seacost deeply troubling.\n\nObviously, Dr. Murphy is not not the primary care. So... who was the radiologist who reported the tumor?\n\nDr. Murphy's closing thoughts don't seem consistent with her emotions. That's a pretty good indicator that someone is not looking at a situation by checking what it means for their worldview but instead taking their worldview as a fixed point and allowing bits and pieces of an external idea to fit into it. I hate to keep using this word but it's deeply disturbing to me. If she truly believes in a God that can **and does** behave as an arbiter then how could she continue her path as a doctor. She spends her whole life affecting her medical judgement when what people really need is to *deserve* healing the way this woman must have. \n\nOther thoughts: Seacoast is using a very post-modern, post-information era evangelism technique. Even a superficial review of how they pop up on the internet demonstrates it. I think this casts a shadow of suspicion over the whole story, because it's a conflict of interest. Seacost is directly implicated in this story, and they are the source, and from *within the context of their evangelism,* it is in their communities best interest for this information to be presented in a way that points towards God. \n\nLet's break down the heuristic that leads to that kind of suspicion: \n\n1. We have not just one, but several extraordinary claims. We would like good standards of evidence and we would like that evidence to be robust because anything less disregards the circumstances. \n\n2. We don't have a source outside of this church.\n\n3. This church has a conflict of interest.\n\n4. One or more of the church's conflicts coincides with altruism (http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7097.html)\n\n5. The Doctor's entological/epistemological shrewdness is almost certainly compromised, so could very-well mean we would wrong to assume she took any personal interest in the medical investigation. \n\n6. No investigation was mentioned. \n\n7. It's unclear to me if the radiologist was a third party\n\n8. No effort was made to present the confirmation of the diagnosis. \n\n9. In deference to cliche -- *if it seems too good to be true it probably is.* God's will is obscured, but clearly all players involved believe that the seacost pastor (?) is implicated in this miracle. Is that not a natural claim that can be analyzed? \n\n**TL;DR2:**\n\n**I've got a decent reason to accept the belief these people have in the story, their personal experiences, the credentials of the people involved, or their conviction. But I have no reason not to doubt the circumstances of the disease and the judgement of the people involved. This is a problem given that to accept this claim is to accept that God likes that woman more than countless others in similar situations. I hope her life offered the universe an amazing return on God's investment... otherwise, why did my best friend's step Dad die? -- Pretty sure he and his wife asked for some help.**	1355291415

I'm not quite sure what attitude you're advocating here. I read the SciAm articles when they came out, I have a subscription. I read one of them again to see if I was missing something though..\n\nLet's try and clear this up.\n\nHere's what I think is the wrong attitude to anecdotes. An extreme example.\n- I got a headache after drinking diet coke. Aspartame causes headaches. Ban aspartame!\n\nHere's what I think is the right attitude. What we need to take out of the articles you linked to.\n- Some people have reported headaches after ingesting aspartame. Let's investigate. Is the connection plausible? Well, maybe the body anticipates a blood suger spike when you ingest something sweet and adjusts it metabolism, and that this mismatch causes some kind of stress. Great, we have a hypothesis. Let's test it. But wait, maybe somebody already have. Let's dive into Pubmed or Google Scholar and look for studies (and let's not ignore those opposing our preconception). Oh and lets get some qualified people to comment on it, it's easy for laymen to misunderstand scientific articles. Or they may be published in bad publications. \n\nThe wrong attitude is to call for conclusions and action based on anecdotes. While calling for discussion and investigation is *never* wrong if you ask me.\n\nHere's the attitude I'm reading out of your comments. Correct me if I'm wrong, I probably am.\n- Some people have reported headaches after ingesting aspartame. They're probably seeing faces in clouds. Let's not talk about it.\n\nSo when people were thinking smoking might contribute to lung cancer, were they seeing faces in clouds? Sure, aspartame causing headaches is perhaps not as plausible as that, but it's way above magic water with memory.\n\nThrough all this bickering about anecdotes we haven't yet actually looked at what studies say about aspartame and headaches. I took a quick look now, but it seems the literature is conflicted. Here's a quote from the abstract of a recent article: "The conflicting results of two recent placebo-control studies of aspartame and headache are discussed. We conclude that aspartame may be an important dietary trigger of headache in some people."\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-4610.1989.hed2902090.x/abstract\n\nI don't have access to the full text though, even through my university.\n\nBut I might not be qualified to analyze these articles anyway. *Which is why I wanted someone more informed to comment on this issue.* What is wrong with that? What am I missing here?	1313534512

Or, the person could even pull out their data enabled phone right there and type in the URL.\n\nA URL is far more informative than an accusatory statement.\n\nAll this sticker does is tell me that the vandal that put it there has a point of view that he's trying to push on to others.

Even if she was a very small woman, if she pushes down with all of her weight she is essentially asking you to do a [front raise](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidAnterior/DBFrontRaise.html) with more than 100 lbs on your arm.\n\nFront raises are a very difficult exercise.  Even very strong people use light weights on them because of the leverages involved: the relatively small anterior shoulder muscles working against your entire arm as a lever.\n\nMy hypothesis: nobody in the class is strong enough to resist when she (or pretty much anyone) actually pushes her hardest.\n\nThe test: find some people who did not see the original experiment, preferably people of different sizes and strengths.  Bring them into the class and repeat the whole thing, but with no "energy slicing".  Just tell them "This guy is going to hold his arm up.  Try to push it down, and he will resist you.  If you push it down, you get a snickers".\n\nA simpler test: go to the gym and try to hold some dumbbells straight out in front of you.  Find the heaviest weight you can hold for a few seconds.  My guess is that it's light enough that any adult could push down that hard without seeming like they are straining too much.  You could even use the cable machine to approximate the motion of pushing someone's arm down, and see how much force you can apply there.	1322662336

Almost all scientists are open to the idea of microbial life in outer space...but that's not the kind we're talking about here. SETI deals with ETI, the stuff we actually do care about. Even then, both institutions are actually quite non-controversial. If microbial life exists, well that's awesome, but it doesn't really mean anything to the average joe. If ETI exists and sends an EM signal, that would be pretty big news, but it would just confirm our assumptions that interstellar space travel or FTL is impossible. The kind of alien life we talk about on this sub-reddit is *very* controversial, that is, the kind that has the ability to travel to Earth from several light years away. It's controversial because it violates general relativity (which we have the utmost confidence in, mind you) which postulates that nothing can travel faster than light. And it seems pretty obvious to me, at least, that if ET is visiting Earth constantly, then it is pretty easy for them to do so (implying that they're using some sort of FTL, and not generation ships or what have you). It will take a heck of an event or unmistakable proof to convince scientists that ET is visiting Earth.	1299658519

I think that gravity stopping tomorrow would be going a bit to far to say that we cannot 'know' that that won't happen. We can be as sure that gravity will continue to work tomorrow as we can about anything behaving according to our current understanding of the laws of physics. That's not to say that we haven't missed something that would allow for gravity to suddenly 'switch off', but that it's unlikely enough to ignore the possibility - until we are given some evidence that would lead us to such conclusions.\n\nI'm not suggesting that we know everything about the world that there is to know, and the scientific community offers that we know very little about the universe as a whole. There are lots of strange things going on out there that we have a very difficult time observing from here. Our lack of knowledge does not give us the excuse to claim into existence a super being capable of creating our universe. 	1325954659

For me the problem is that she describes skepticism as a "culture".  It's like describing atheism as a religion:\n\n&gt;It is possible that our two warring cultures will never build a bridge across the deep rift that divides us. I know that in my own case, the transition from my culture to yours was long, arduous, and deeply painful.\n\nShe still appears to cling to the fallacy of the golden mean, when there is no half way point between idiocy and reason.  Of course they'll never bridge the gap.  It's like expecting Dawkins to concede that some dinosaurs lived among humans, and maybe humans don't all share a common ancestor with other primates.\n\n	1281402072

&gt;I think that if you want to argue that the history of the United States makes it particularly violent and our comparatively lax gun laws, in comparison to Denmark, Japan, and Switzerland, have nothing to do with that, then I'd invite you to do the research yourself and make that argument.\n\nI never said this. I said that I believed the simply discussing relationship between number of guns and rate of gun-related violence isn't nuanced enough.\n\n&gt;Regarding your point about the baggage of slavery, all three of our example nations other than the US had a relationship to slavery or similar extreme oppression of ethnic groups. Slavery was abolished in the Danish colonies in 1848, only 17 years before the 13th amendment was ratified.[1] 1848 is also the same year Switzerland became a federal state[2] after a frankly confusing history of being a loose confederation, or annexed by napoleon, or whatnot. Only existing as the modern state when slavery was already on the way out did not stop Switzerland from profiting from and aiding the slave trade, however.[3]\n\nAt least in the United States, abolishing slavery only ended institutionalized slavery.  (It was actually interesting to learn that Denmark suffered similar issues after abolishing slavery as did the U.S., which is that many simply became indentured servants by continuing to work for their previous captor, only now they were an employer and had no obligation to feed or shelter them.  That's not an argument against the abolition of slavery, I just found it interesting.) How diverse are the populations in our example countries compared to the U.S.? \n\nOnly 6% of Switzerland's population is non-European.  \n99% of Japan is Japanese\n97% of Denmark is Danish\n\nAnd that's not at all mean to suggest either of these countries lacks diversity at all. But none of them have significant populations of former slaves. My mom and dad went to school when black Americans were not allowed to drink from the same water fountains as whites.  I'm not that old.  I'm 27. That absolutely still effects this country today.  	1355800796
Personally I tend to view them as more humourous than depressing.

Again, I'm not really convinced that a new born is learning to latch. That would also seem to require that they're able to reposition their head, with a newborn human child it's up to the mother to position the child's head and her breast to make it easy for the baby to suck.	1335107759

Their "story" wasn't a particularly complicated one. It consisted of them seeing an object and that aliens came out of it. What's to get wrong?

agreed, I am so surprised about the emotion and energy that my fellow able bodied, healthy young friends put behind legalization of cannabis for medical purposes.

&gt;I wonder if human civilizations were used/exploited by the "gods" in an effort to mine the planet of its gold\n\nI am of the opinion that if a civilization has the technology and power to travel the universe then there is nothing we have that they would want. \n\nEven to assume for a moment that they did need gold there most certainly are planets that are closer and easier to obtain it from than here.\n\n&gt;Is the thought that an advanced civilization would be interested in studying the human species a narcissistic fantasy \n\nMost certainly it is.\n\n&gt;What if we're no more interesting to aliens than lemur colonies are to a logging company?\n\nI definitely think there are a few scenarios here that could exist. Intelligent life could be so common that it is no longer worth studying for them. Conversely intelligent life could be so rare that we are indeed being studied and perhaps even "protected" from ourselves. Personally I think the most likely scenario lies somewhere in the middle where they have a primary objective and studying us could be a secondary or, probably, a tertiary objective.\n\nUltimately the problem is that we don't have nearly enough knowledge of what goes on outside of our planet to make an educated guess either way.	1305919574

&gt;Harabeck we were having an actual discussion here\n\nNot really dude. I gave you a good starting point for a discussion, but you're just following up with empty rhetoric.\n\n&gt;My point was not that I'm right and you're wrong, my point was that you haven't considered the other side of the argument because you've given in to ridicule and propaganda, that your opinion is skewed and you don't know it, therefore you aren't being truly skeptical.\n\nAgain, that's a lot of mind reading going on there. How do you know that's what I did? How do you know that I'm just not considering the side of the argument you agree with? How do you know I haven't spent hours and hours considering the evidence objectively? You don't. But you assume that because I don't agree with you, and that's why we aren't having a discussion. You are trying to tell me what's wrong with me, but you haven't bothered to find out anything about my position further than I disagree with you. And yet, you claim to be the voice of reason here. That's why the discussion has stalled. I'm telling you that you're being a jackass and just repeating the same bare assertion that I'm wrong with absolutely no support, and you just respond with more of the same. A discussion is a two way dialogue, not you telling me what I think.\n\n&gt;And then you make a little snide comment about how I wrote a lot? \n\nWhat? I'm saying you aren't writing enough. Or at least, nothing of substance.\n\nIf you want a discussion, then fine, let's have one. Go back to what I said here:\n\n&gt;I have seen no convincing evidence of such a conspiracy. Badly misinterpreted quotes, coincidences, and completely retarded interpretations of video do not make an actual conspiracy. Unless you have some new bombshell I haven't seen before...?\n\nAnd this time answer it. Tell me why my position is unreasonable and could only be a product of bias. What evidence has you so convinced?	1331221261
Excellent, I am occasionally struck by this when listening to the *Skeptics Guide to the Universe*. The most recent was the complete dismissal of tidal forces having any possible effect on seismic activity.\n\nThey were ridiculing some charlatan who claimed to be able to predict earthquakes, but that doesn't mean something that they acknowledged creates a 1-foot bulge in the lithosphere couldn't also affect the movement of plates in relation to each other. In fact it seems like it is even a likely 'straw that broke the camels back'. In other words the earthquakes in NZ and Japan wouldn't have occurred with the tidal forces alone, but they might have occurred when they did, rather than a year from now, because of the specific tidal forces that the plates were experiencing at the time of the quakes.	1300696985

...it's complicated.\n\nGo google "healing crisis."  I'll wait.\n\nBack?\n\nI'll bet you saw a lot of woo that you didn't quite understand so lemme break it down for you: in the land of pseudoscience, a "healing crisis" is what your body does as you "detox" from whatever it is that ails you.  It manifests as your symptoms getting radically worse as you treat them with whatever unscientific method you choose to throw at it.  This is hailed as a "good sign" because it means you're getting better - you just have to get worse first.  \n\nSo someone who sees an iridologist, gets treated by magnets or whatever, and then gets markedly worse is *not*, in fact, "getting worse."  They are suffering a "healing crisis" and are on the road to recovery, presuming they have the power to stick it out.\n\nAs I've mentioned in here, my wife has a doctorate in naturopathic medicine.  Her first year at school they tried to treat her eczema with homeopathy.  She was game, because hey - if you're taking the degree, you ought to expose yourself to all the modalities you're learning.  So she got her prescription magic sugar pills and was told to discontinue all the lotions and cortisone creams she was using and lo and behold, her hands started looking *terrible.*  Which was a problem, as she was delivering babies, and her hands looked like something out of a Romero film - red, cracked, inflamed, terrible.  She'd cry at night from the pain.\n\nThe homeopaths, though, were THRILLED.  She was having a "healing crisis."  It was working!  Soon she'd be all better!  Yay!\n\nThe problem is that the worse you get, the more complete your recovery.  Right?  *Right?*  So the longer you suffer, the better you'll be in the end.  Right?\n\nThat was our "come to jesus" moment with alternative medicine - I pointed out that she couldn't function the way she was and there was no reason to believe that the homeopathy was doing anything.  She knew, logically, it couldn't do anything.  I knew, logically, it couldn't do anything.  So she went to the dermatologist, got some wicked steroid cream, and cured the fuck out of her hands.\n\n...which worked out nicely with the naturopathic treatment recommended - change her diet to avoid the allergens that were irritating her skin (wheat and dairy).  So clear of wheat and dairy, and with her hands on the mend via steroid cream, she had creamy-smooth skin with no blemishes inside of a month.  But there was a very real crisis of faith in the middle there, and the homeopathy department never forgave her.\n\nThis iridologist may well have *believed* in the "healing crisis" and thereby, convinced the woman not to discontinue treatment.  That's how things like [parents letting eczema kill their child](http://www.smh.com.au/national/parents-guilty-of-manslaughter-over-daughters-eczema-death-20090605-bxvx.html) happens.  Now, granted- you have to be in total denial of all the evidence against your trade in order to believe this.  You need to have willfully walled off part of your mind against logic.  But once you've done that, you can *believe* that a woman's skull eroding is a *good thing.*  Then, later during the inquest, someone says \n\n*"c'mon, woman.  You saw her brain eating through her skull.  You knew this was seriously terrible yet you did nothing.  Admit that this was beyond your expertise.*"\n\nAt that point, you get a *mea culpa* as the practitioner, who has suffered a total crisis of faith, collapses.  Because at some point, you have to acknowledge that your medicine killed someone, and it's all your fault.	1346690928

It just makes zero sense that these would be helicopters; far too many bad ideas going on if it were. Helicopters are not just toys; they have people who own them and care for them.	1321885833

Bike helmets are pretty flimsy structures. I can see them only making a marginal difference in a marginal number of accidents.\n\nRiders who obey the rules of the road are less likely to have accidetns, more likely to be careful and experienced riders and more likely to wear helmets.\n\nIf we really care about cyclist's safety we would do better to license cyclists just as we do cars. Make them pass a test after doing a riding course. Have them carry a license plate front and back. Have the police ticket them just as they would cars for any infringement of the rules of the road. That would have a far greater effect on reducing cycling deaths and injuries than mandatory helmet wearing. And I say this as an avide cyclist who does not own a car and rides probably 200 K a week in city traffic. For every motorist doing something dangerous and stupid to cyclists I see at least 10 cyclists doing it to themselves.	1311879073

Balance is a subjective word. I think we are in balance, are you so arrogant to believe that a little species like ourselves can have any real impact on a a natural balance? Sure as the pendulum swings it reaches a max hieght, but it always returns to the middle before it swings the opposite direction.  We already see thousands of applications of sine waves in nature, who's to say that humanity and technology do not also follow suit?  Nature is larger than us, we are a part of it, anything we do is "natural".  There is no larger plan for us, no higher existence.  We are what we are. And at the end of the day we will see if we are a species capable of changing its fate.	1352825790

What that sentence means is exactly what it says: there is currently no compelling reason to currently recommend ***or reject*** acupuncture, but "some encouraging data do exist that warrant further investigation in independent rigorous trials." These scientists, and the scientists who write the independent Cochrane reviews (which are [independent, highly respected research reviews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review#Cochrane_Collaboration) designed to help practitioners keep up on research, especially in areas of clinical practice that are unsettled) reviewed all extant data on humans and domestic animals and both reached the same conclusion: at present, there's no compelling reason to accept or reject acupuncture, and some of the data looks promising. I don't have any stake in the acupuncture game, but I also don't like to pretend I know better than the scientists who have read and critiqued all of the available literature in this area. 	1326210877

It's definitely true that futurist predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, but what about the central empirical claims that a) we can create AI of "equal intelligence" to our own, and b) AI of "equal intelligence" to our own could design further AIs that were "more intelligent" (where "intelligence" here is a pretty vague term but has to do with the various cognitive capacities relevant to reasoning about the world and manipulating it for the agent's own purposes). Those claims seem pretty reasonable to me, and not at all like religious claims. I know the Singularity stuff carries with it particular baggage (such as when AIs-designing-smarter-AIs will occur, how fast the process will be, and the social consequences of that process) but it doesn't seem to me that the main two points I mentioned above are (pseudo-)religious claims.	1335062712

OK one thing is they refer to a Lancet article, *but do not include a link!* Well after looking around, they probably mean [this study](http://www.foodbase.org.uk//admintools/reportdocuments/137-1-233_additivesbehaviourfinrep.pdf) (PDF) commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency.\n\nAs with most of these studies they found a statistical link (perhaps someone can look into the statistics I do not have the time), but a statistical link in 1 single study with only 130 participants does not mean very much yet. Problem is also, that they found some hyperactivity, but strangely 3 year olds became hyperactive from mixture A (Mix A for 3-year-old children included 20 mg of artificial food colourings (5 mg sunset  yellow  [E110],  2·5  mg  carmoisine  [E122],  7·5  mg  tartrazine  [E102], and  5  mg  ponceau  4R  [E124)  and  45  mg  of sodium  benzoate). \n\nWhereas 8 year olds became hyperactive from Mix B ( Active  Mix  B \nincluded  30  mg  of  artificial  food  colourings  (7·5  mg  sunset  yellow,  7·5  mg carmoisine, 7·5 mg quinoline yellow [E104], and 7·5 mg allura red AC [E129]) and 45 mg of sodium benzoate. )\n\nSo this link is tenuous at least.\n\nThe rest are all bunk.	1321915330

re: what jaxxil_ said:\n\n&gt;  First of all, it claims to cure cancer. Red flag in itself. All types, too, apparently! \n\nCancer is not a single disease. Even breast cancer is not, in its, a single disease. See this paper, (among many others):\n\n&gt; **Modelling breast cancer: one size does not fit all**\n\n&gt; by Tracy Vargo-Gogola1 &amp; Jeffrey M. Rosen\n\n&gt; Breast cancer is not a single disease, but is instead a collection of diseases that have distinct histopathological features, genetic and genomic variability, and diverse prognostic outcomes. Thus, no individual model would be expected to completely recapitulate this complex disease. Here, the models commonly used to investigate breast cancer including cell lines, xenografts and genetically engineered mice, are discussed to help address the question: what is the most powerful way to investigate this heterogeneous disease?\n\n[http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v7/n9/abs/nrc2193.html](http://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v7/n9/abs/nrc2193.html)\n\nFor that reason, there will never be a single cancer cure.	1348682079
&gt;Belief in the paranormal\n\nAs distinct from interest in the subject.\n\nI have never believed in the paranormal, whatever that means. But I've been interested in the subject since 1962.\n\nParanormal is somewhat of a misnomer. If something occurs in reality, regardless of how frequent or infrequent, strange or mundane, it is what I would call "normal". At least as compared to the general public perception of paranormal.\n\nWebster's online dictionary lists a definition of paranormal as, "not scientifically explainable". This too is not exactly correct. More accurate would be, "not *currently* scientifically explainable".\n\n[Sometimes belief that a thing is so might be paranormal for a time, then, frequently suddenly, be quite normal/scientifically explainable.](http://www.dinofish.com/)\n\nAnother example:\n\nThe giant squid, possibly formerly known as the kraken.\n\n&gt;On at least three occasions in the 1930's they reportedly attacked a ship.\n\n [Many times in past centuries these attacks were said to have transpired. These stories, until recently were generally  considered ignorant "tales" particularly among the scientific community. There is every reason to believe that ignorance is not restricted to ancient times.](http://unmuseum.mus.pa.us/kraken.htm)\n\n[Kevin Smith says he does not believe in UFOs.](http://kevinsmith.mypodcast.com/)	1227003154

As mentioned above, there are indeed viewers that are not sufficiently critical regarding possible conventional explanations to certain aerial phenomena.  However (and regarding the "balloon blowing in the wind" example alone that you gave), I myself have also *very* often seen individuals who seem to have a knee jerk reaction calling almost any small, round, floating, luminous object in the sky a "balloon blowing in the wind" when, the fact of the matter is that a balloon blowing in the wind exhibits characteristics of instability that many of these aerial objects actually do *not* exhibit.  Under these types of circumstances, the individual claiming a more conventional explanation is, in fact, little more than an uncritical naysayer and is just as detrimental to valid observation as the individual who is too quick to call the object a UFO.\n\nA third party observer (presumably you, for example) looking from the outside in at the different manners which phenomena are describe should themselves be very critical of *how* things are described and the validity with which observers on *either* side of the phenomenon analyze things - realizing that there are both critical and uncritical observations made on both sides.  Ultimately, what one should do is simply discard all UFO and ET phenomena and observations that are uncritical and invalid.  There will be a very big pile - as there is a lot of disinformation, etc out there.  After you're done discarding the mountain of incorrect data, you'll find - if you yourself are critical and astute enough - that there will *still* be a certain percentage that will be valid and not explainable by any conventional, terrestrial means.\n\nAt the of the day, even if .5% of the thousands upon untold thousands of sightings are valid - heck, if even one in many *millions* is valid - then that alone is still proof that the phenomenon is real, and ETs exist.	1338668429

Not to act like a conspiracy theorist or anything but if our government lied to us I don't think they would be the first establishment to do so.

No one was there.\nI asked my mother about It (being 19 at the time) she reconised it right away and said its called an old hag.	1344919422

I did a good read on this after my brother got into it. I did find I good well written and referenced set of short [papers](http://www.beyondveg.com/cat/paleodiet/index.shtml) on the various topics discussed and follwed a good few of the primary papers up. The stuff about grains being toxic seems to hold true and it does seem to have a fairly scientific basis. You should check it out once your finals are over.\n\nIt just needs some good clinical trials to be carried out to prove some of its claims. But there's certainly no evidence for it being bad for you as far as I read.\n\nIf anything encouraging people to eat a lot more veg and think about the quality of their food and cut down on processed foods is certainly good. If it was me though I'd sooner cut back on things like grain rather than remove them completely. I love bacon butties too much.	1303772980

&gt;When did I ever claim that he was wrong? You stated that it first free fell at this speed.\n\nI'm not only claiming it, I actually *showed* you **video evidence**.  You, however, are hung up on how the penthouse itself collapsed seconds before and are again confusing the total duration of collapse of other elements that may or may not have affected the actual *building* collapse.\n\n&gt;NIST even reports free fall after the initial collapse.\n\n*sigh* NIST left out entire sections of evidence (again, as pointed out by the SE in the previous video linked.) They're a joke.\n\n&gt;Never said it. But even so, evidence against concept A isn't evidence for concept B. Please take a logic class once in your life. Spare me having to continuously discuss the finer points with you.\n\nSo, what the fuck are you defending, then? Either it collapsed per the mainstream theory (heat/fires) - **or** it collapsed due to explosions.  That's it. Inside or Outside Job. (or even a combination of the two.)\n\n&gt;And I say, Then HE SHOULD PROVE IT!\n\n...*facepalm*.... a  **high school** teacher proved it.  Did. You. Watch the video? You never *once* explicitly stated what was *wrong* w/ his science other than denying it.\n\n&gt;So your claim is that it was a controlled demolition? So how did the 7 hour fires not set off or damage the devices before hand? &lt;emotionally knee-jerked, loaded questions that have no relevance to the actual topic at  hand&gt;.... how do you explain that?\n\nYou don't understand. For a supposed skeptic, you're asking all these questions like, "how come people didn't notice, how could all these people be involved, etc. etc.". I **already** addressed all of that. To speak to the motivations or the level of people involved is nothing but pure conjecture and no amount of science can prove anything. It's all conjecture. But, regardless, you're allowing your **pre-conceived** human **emotions** get the best of you and b/c of this you're simply shutting down any possibility of anything outside of the bubble of how you **think** the world should operate.\n\nI mean, it would be like someone living in a small town whose wife was brutally raped and murdered.  All the evidence pointed at the beloved/highly respected local Sheriff. I mean, this guy was loved by *everyone* - but, in spite of his semen on her dress, and his finger prints on her car door, and her blood in his office you'd sit back and say "no!! that just couldn't happen!! Imagine how many people would have had to been in on the conspiracy. And, I just can't believe that anyway - it's just not possible.  He's a good guy!!" Well, sorry - the evidence says otherwise. Suck it up, the man is a rapist and murderer.\n\n&gt;LITERALLY no evidence\n\nI can't even laugh anymore. I mean, it's thoughtless statements like this that make me think you're just a troll or a shill. No, see, there's no evidence **that you like**. There's no evidence **that you're comfortable with.** You're so, so horribly biased and have allowed your emotions to take over, that, you're fighting *any* kind of dissenting voice (w/ hatred, no less). I sincerely feel sorry for you.\n\nNo, see, there's LITERALLY no evidence that Elvis Presley is living on a moon base now. There is a copious amount of evidence that explosives brought down Bldg. 7.  \n\nRegardless, it's interesting - you are fighting this w/ so much vitriol and determination, yet, you haven't provided what you think is the best theory for collapse.  Seriously, you say you don't buy the mainstream theory, and you clearly don't buy the implosion theory - let's hear yours.\n\n	1350476674

I get what you're saying too. I honestly think the culture was different back then. We didn't take photos of stuff if it wasn't on vacation or at a big party and post them on Facebook? I don't know really. I was a freshmen in high school when this happened and I had a lot of pictures of me and my friends. Perhaps it isn't an excuse.\n\nI just trying to come up with an answer for your question. It really is kind of baffling. Maybe there *are* photos out there but the people just never came forward with them after seeing the governor mock the incident and stuff? Maybe people took them and they didn't turn out?	1310946600

Indeed.  I think the main point being, we need to be skeptical about every anomalous claim without being completely closed to the idea that *any* evidence must, of necessity, be physical evidence of the "nuts and bolts" variety.  Anecdotal data can be every bit as compelling (and telling) as physical data.  It's how it is used and referenced that makes all the difference in the world.	1332279285

China's literacy rate is only 93.6 percent. That is high historically, but every genuinely developed country is at 99 percent or more.\n\nChina has at least 60 million illiterate citizens. What does that say about the number who might use computers?\n\nEnglish is the language of computing. The future is being built by Chinese speakers' hands but English speakers' voices and Roman letters.\n\nUsers of Roman alphabets outnumber users of Chinese pictographic systems.\n\nMandarin is very important now, but it won't be able to eclipse English the way English eclipsed French. It can't become lingua Franca without a definitive victory because an English document in front of a Spanish speaker looks like foreign words, but a Mandarin document looks like a drawing of bugs dancing.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the various Germanic and Scandinavian languages merged. I wouldn't be surprised if French and Italian merged or were subsumed by Spanish. I wouldn't be surprised if all the EU member countries gradually became so permeated with English speakers that their original languages started to dwindle. I just cannot see the alphabet switch happening anytime soon. It's a tremendously difficult adjustment.	1299780386

It's based on a combination of science and logical reasoning.\n\nLogical reasoning:  Evolution is a valid thing.  Organisms evolve acting a certain way in a certain environment.  Bodies are optimized to work in that way in that environment.  For optimal health, mimic those activity patterns and diet.\n\nScientifically: The general diet and activity prescriptions are well backed.  Be active with a wide range of intensity.  Avoid high carbohydrate intake.  Avoid non-ancestral foods (many, though not all, of which see widespread intolerances and the like: wheat gluten and lactose, for two large examples) and certain macronutrient profiles (avoid foodstuffs with a large amount of carbohydrate and fat, as these are shown to promote the most weight gain).  Largely, the prescriptions of a paleo methodology match up with peer reviewed scientific data.  Not all aspects are scientifically supported, but none that I know of are conclusively opposed.	1347595803

I remember reading about Global Warming in a kid's magazine (ranger Rick, IIRC) about global warming in the early to mid ninties.  My (arch-conservative) grandmother immediatly put a copy of some other magazine, which had a single sentance that said "Scientists have come to agree there is no such thing as global warming". (paraphrasing, obviously.

Just my own experience.  Like everyone, I haven't seen any doc that has proven anything. \n\nI grew up watching all the supposed reality supernatural stories on UPN (old network), checked out The Amityville Horror Story from my school library, and really just tried to keep my mind open. I was convinced the eyes in my posters would follow me around my roon.  As I grew older though, my faith started to fade and any tales of the supernatural were just that.  George and Kathy Lutz had sold their house to get out of their mortgage.   \n\nYou can imagine my shock and disbelief when it happened to me. Actually, I take that back. Unless you've shared something similar yourself, you will probably just consider me a crazy person.\n I sometimes do. I tend to over think everything naturally.\n\nIt was a few years ago and it happened in the house I live in now. I remember watching movies as a kid and thinking "I would just move if something like that happened to me".  But here I am in my early 30's, house of my own, a decent amount of money to my name and still it's just not that easy. If the Lutz's had tried to cheat their mortgage company it's easy to see why.\n\nBack to the point. It was late at night and I was sitting at my computer desk.  I was browsing the net (probably Reddit) when I thought I felt my phone go off in my pocket. Although, it was sitting right in front of me. On the base to my monitor. I scooted back in my chair and looked down to see my right pant pocket rolling around wildly as if someone was **Digging Through It!**. \n\nI remember being shocked. Looking from my pocket to my phone, my phone to my pocket.  I couldn't believe what was going on.  It didn't make sense. I patted my pocket flat as if it had caught fire naively thinking it would stop. When it didn't, I froze. I don't remember how long it was until I gained enough courage to stand up but I remember my pocket still moving continuously until I did. Unfortunately, even when I was standing I could still feel the fingernails brushing against my thigh. Finally, I was freaked the F out.  \n\nI threw my chair back and left for the living room where my brother and his gf at the time were watching tv. Right away they knew something was wrong.  I only asked if I could watch tv with them for a while.  I never sat down.  I felt so much safer being in the room with them that I just stood there. Speechless. It wasn't that I couldn't talk. It was that I didn't know how to explain or what to explain. Nothing I would've said would have made them take me seriously. Finally about 20 min later I filled them in. I remember for months after that, late at night staring at the lights of my ceiling fan. Too scared to close my eyes.\n\nA few more occurrences happened and I was starting to feel targeted.  Again though, I felt like I had no one to talk to or share with.  My family is very loving and loyal but we are all sensible.  I ended up getting pretty emotional about it.  My view on reality had been broken.  I tried to make sense of it.  Maybe I was tired and I was seeing things- I felt it first and that is what drew my attention.\n\nI am still in the same house but now stay in a different bedroom.  I really don't expect anyone to read all of that it just was nice to get it out of my system. I will leave you with a \n\n**TL:DR**\n\n**I was a complete skeptic til a ghost played pocket pool with me and taunted me til I switched rooms.**  \n\nedit: Typed the word if instead of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n	1340866375

TV and films certainly appear to give the impression that things are possible when they aren't, and I think a lot of people take what they see on the screen as a reflection of reality.\n\nThat said, even if it weren't for TV and film, I think people might still have a false impression of what's possible, just through lack of knowledge. So I while they don't help, I don't think it really makes much difference.	1317859712

Yes, I'm familiar with the four noble truths. They're metaphysical concepts, not testable hypotheses.\n\n&gt; These are not supernatural elements, they're a finger pointing at the moon. The terminology is meaningless outside of its context, but within its context it produces results.\n\nThe idea of "the finger pointing at the moon" is that you can't explain a concept, you can only point at it with words. Instead it requires subjective interpretation and understanding. But a hypothesis must be objective and measurable for it to be falsifiable.\n\n&gt; Check out these studies on mindfulness meditation.\n\nSure, meditation has various specific effects.

A case report of a man** \n\n **immersed in crushed ice for 80 minutes.** \n\n\n.\n\n                  \nJan T Groothuis, Thijs M Eijsvogels , Ralph R Scholten, Dick HJ Thijssen, Maria TE Hopman \n\n**Departments of Physiology and Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Radboud University Nijmegen** \n\n**Medical Centre** and **Department of Rehabilitation, St Maartenskliniek; Nijmegen, The Netherlands**; \n\nand **Research Institute for Sports and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University,** \n\n **Liverpool, United Kingdom.**\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Background:** \n\nThe autonomic nervous system responds independently, autonomously and automatically \n\nto changes in the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system and thermoregulation. **However, the world** \n\n**record holder of full-body ice immersion claims he can influence his autonomic nervous system** \n\n**through the Asian Tummo meditation technique, which is associated with descriptions of intense** \n\n**sensations of body heat. We, therefore, assessed the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses to** \n\n **full-body ice immersion in this individual.**\n\n.\n\n**Methods:**\n \n.\n\n**A 51 year old male was fully immersed in crushed ice for 80 minutes whilst performing** \n\n**Asian Tummo meditation.** Blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously using an \n\nautomatic blood pressure device. Core body and skin temperature were measured continuously using \n\nan ingestible telemetric temperature pill and wireless sensors, respectively. Oxygen consumption was \n\nmeasured using pulmonary gas exchange every 30 minutes. \n\n.\n\n\n**Results:** \n\n\nCore body temperature during the 80-minute ice immersion period decreased gradually from \n\n37.7 to 37.1°C. Skin temperature decreased at the upper limbs from 28 to 5°C and at the lower limbs \n\nfrom 28 to 18°C. No immediate blood pressure or heart rate response at the beginning of full-body ice \n\nimmersion was observed. Over the full 80-minute ice immersion period, blood pressure gradually \n\nincreased from 128/84 to 163/97 mmHg and heart rate from 70 to 90 bpm. Oxygen consumption \n\ndoubled from 5.7 at baseline to 11.0 ml/min/kg during immersion and remained stable. \n\n.\n\n\n**Conclusions:** \n\n\nNo immediate blood pressure and heart rate responses were observed, as typically \n\nobserved when (partially) submerged into ice(water). Despite 80 minutes of full-body ice immersion \n\nand significant heat loss through the skin, **core body temperature was maintained probably by an** \n\n**increased energy expenditure (and therefore heat production).** This individual may have influenced the \n\nautonomic nervous system, thereby actively regulating the cardiovascular system and \n\nthermoregulation. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(this is about Wim Hof and Tummo (inner fire) meditation)**\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685240\n\nThe influence of concentration/meditation on autonomic nervous system activity and the innate immune response: a case study.\n\n\nKox M, Stoffels M, Smeekens SP, van Alfen N, Gomes M, Eijsvogels TM, Hopman MT, van der Hoeven JG, Netea MG, Pickkers P.\nSource\n\nDepartment of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.kox@ic.umcn.nl\nAbstract\n\n\n**OBJECTIVE:**\n\nIn this case study, we describe the effects of a particular individual's concentration/meditation technique on autonomic nervous system activity and the innate immune response. The study participant holds several world records with regard to tolerating extreme cold and claims that he can influence his autonomic nervous system and thereby his innate immune response.\n\n\n**METHODS:**\n\nThe individual's ex vivo cytokine response (stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) was determined before and after an 80-minute full-body ice immersion during which the individual practiced his concentration/meditation technique. Furthermore, the individual's in vivo innate immune response was studied while practicing his concentration/mediation technique during human endotoxemia (intravenous administration of 2 ng/kg LPS). The results from the endotoxemia experiment were compared with a historical cohort of 112 individuals who participated in endotoxemia experiments in our institution.\n\n**RESULTS:**\n\nThe ex vivo proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response was greatly attenuated by concentration/meditation during ice immersion, accompanied by high levels of cortisol. In the endotoxemia experiment, concentration/meditation resulted in increased circulating concentrations of catecholamines, and plasma cortisol concentrations were higher than in any of the previously studied participants. The individual's in vivo cytokine response and clinical symptoms after LPS administration were remarkably low compared with previously studied participants.\n\n\n**CONCLUSIONS:**\n\n**The concentration/meditation technique used by this particular individual seems to evoke a controlled stress response. This response is characterized by sympathetic nervous system activation and subsequent catecholamine/cortisol release, which seems to attenuate the innate immune response.**\n\n	1349076208
Apparently, with the right audio frequency through headphones, you can observe marked differences in behavior. These differences are argued to influence increased brain activation at a particular frequency. A friend does some memory research on theta wave, but as I have not read to far into her line of research, I can't really provide specifics. I know other people in our department think it's bogus, but we're all scientists, so it's scientific skepticism from the get-go. \n\nSuffice-to-say, these brain wave definitions are involved in real scientific experiments, usually with an EEG machine hooked up to some poor guy/gal's noggin. Jury is still out on the results, though.	1339658876
Can't argue with your chemistry breakdown, definitely thorough. I do understand where your hypothesis of the low absorption rate comes from, however, as we designed this supplement we found its overall effects to be faster and more potent with the Magnetite ingredient than compared to other sources of iron.  You can looked at this through the lens of how the Magnetite interacts with the body as an isolated ingredient, but more importantly we measured the results of the supplement as a whole, and how all of the ingredients work together.\n\nI really do appreciate your detailed breakdown of the chemistry process, will run it buy our chemist who aided in the R&amp;D of designing the supplement to get this thoughts.

Is English not your first language? This would explain a lot. \n\n&gt;I thought you said the science is clear?\n\nRight, I did say that.\n\n&gt;Now you're saying the findings of scientists isn't credible? Which is it?\n\nNo, Im not saying that at all. I said "This is one of the things that people remember and prevents them from lending any credibility...."\n\nPeople. Many people. You know, the ones that we always point to in these threads such as this very thread.\n\nSo again, I have said and continue to say that the science is clear while there are many people who do not agree. \n\nAcid rain was not a hoax because it continues to be an issue today however small. It was however blown way out of proportion and when you have numerous liberal outlets killing off the issue and burying it you can be certain of this. Not to mention the facts show it to have been exaggerated. \n	1354405288

Spirits communicate best through dreams, as does your own subconscious mind; and the dreams are vivid according to the strength of the emotions driving them. There are clean and unclean spirits, but dream interaction with demons and angels is exceptional. Clean spirits very often convey useful information, and the unclean an opportunity to help them pass over (though their dreams can be quite disturbing); interaction with a discarnate celestial/extra-dimensional being is always unmistakable; listen to your heart, and not your superstitious, bullying friend.	1328726289
It's one of those things that if it is true (and I do have my doubts) it will almost certainly only be one of a number of contributing factors. \n\nI would bet money diet and sedentary lifestyles will be far more important.\n\nAs someone who is well versed in losing a bunch of weight (through diet and exercise) alarm bells always go off whenever you hear someone like the scientist mentioned who says they cannot lose weight whatever they do. 99.9% of the time they are simply eating too much and dont realise it. \n\nas exemplified by (this from a BBC doc)[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nWvQ0Q-VEA] which is tracks the calories of an overweight actress, who 'eats right', is active etc etc. She has to do a video diary at the end of the day for part, a written diary for another part and a they also use a technique with some chemical that allows them to acurately track calorie intake.\n\nTurns out she put on average 1100 cal a day in her end of day diary, she was eating on average over 3000 cal per day. the written diary under-reported by 43% and the national average is about 50%.	1327444627

Apparently the best evidence for NDEs being evidence of consciousness existing separate from the brain is the story of Pam Reynolds...

We're finally starting to unravel how the brain works without resorting to non-answers such as spirits. Since Alan Turing's seminal paper on computable numbers was published, we have had a frame work in which to understand the brain, and it is proving to be very fruitful in helping us understand the brain/mind.	1324784167

I'm not sure. I think there are a *lot* of checks and balances in the system already. But I don't really know in any level of detail, so I am only guessing. The problem here is that we are getting in to political bureaucracy vs private company interests. It is complicated. Way too complicated. Almost as complicated as the science which it is all about.\n\nThis seems to me to be the real issue here. We have miultiple layers of complexity, and when random yokels think they can see the truth from their outside perspective of ignorance...that is just absurd. ..just... sigh... because the theoretical science, the research based science, the commercialisation of that science, the balance and checking of the safety of the implementation, the financial underpinning of it, and ultimately the final distribution and marketing of those products....

In order for a nuclear explosion to occur, their must be a critical mass of radioactive substance. Fuel pellets are only 3% uranium and the rest is thorium in most cases. In order for material to create a nuclear explosion to occur the concentration would need to be much higher. So high in fact that it would have needed to be enriched. As far as heat and thermal damage, The graphite used as the medium of cooling was already on fire, and even that didn't cause an explosion. What did cause the explosion was a meltdown, and the resulting expansion of steam, to almost a thousand times the volume when it was under pressure.	1337373930

I was about 12 or 13 spending the night at a friend's house, goofing around with the Ouija board with him &amp; his sister and we were getting all sorts of gibberish plus words spelled out, just kind of scaring ourselves for fun not taking it very seriously when we got the message "I can see you through the window" and then "I can see you through his eyes" or something like that...there was just a small window in the basement room where we were, and just the back yard and woods past the driveway visible through that window...we asked it more questions and it said "I'm under the car" so we somehow got up the nerve to go out with a flashlight and peer under the car, where we saw a huge black stray cat which was hissing. We ran inside freaking out and at that exact moment the power failed and all the lights in the house went out. We just about actually shit ourselves. Few minutes later the power came back and we sat up til dawn that night scared and never played with the board again.	1331517834

Yes, but you also have to appreciate that the lives of children are at risk, so it calls for taking action that is most prudent, not the one that most ideologically sound.

[As seen here](http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/sitchinerrors.htm)\n\n&gt;*the ancient Mesopotamian scribes created dictionaries.  Lists of words are a common feature among the thousands of Sumerian and Akkadian cuneiform tablets which have been discovered by archaeologists.  Many are just groupings of common words, while others represent an inventory of the word meanings of the languages used in Mesopotamia.*\n\n&gt;*These "lexical lists", as scholars call them, were indispensable to the 19th century scholars who deciphered the Sumerian and Akkadian texts, for they were used to compile modern dictionaries of these languages.  Today all major lexical texts have been published in the multi-volume set, **[Materials for the Sumerian Lexicon](http://www.sumerian.org/sumerlex.htm)**, begun by Benno Landsberger in the 1930s.*\n\n[NOTE, free pdf download at link]\n\n&gt;*It is indeed a rare instance where ancient dictionaries of a dead language form the core of the modern dictionaries used by scholars of today.  Such is the case for the ancient languages of Sumer and Akkad.*\n\n&gt;*Sadly,  Mr. Sitchin neglects these resources.*	1277344416
There are no taxes... taxes are manditory... this system is 100% voluntary. If you think a public pool for education that everyone can take money from is a good idea, you put into that pool. If you don't want to contribute to such a pool, you don't put money into it. As for how the money in these pools gets spent, that's entirely up to democratic vote by those who put money in.... which means that I could set up a pool specifically to  cover education costs of people in my geographic region who want to take software development courses and have a highschool average of 90% ... and everyone who puts into that pool can then vote on which students should get the money, and what the stipulations will be for them to continue getting funded. \n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg in regards to what we can do with technology if we put our minds to the task. \n\nBut yes, I can see which information I forgot to add now...

I haven't actually encountered any crazy claims from the SETI folks though.

Yes, Travis did say they took certain liberties with the movie as filmmaker do. The funny thing is, no one saw him enter a craft. He woke up somewhere strange. He was unconscious when they left him beside the road. So, who knows where the hell he really was, you know? For all we know, he could of been underground in a facility.	1350171745
The amount of sense you are making is stabilizing, not increasing - doesn't that scare you?\n\nFor future reference; when replying to someone, make an effort to make your reply have *some* connection to what was said. Otherwise, your comment is better off as a stand-alone. \nIn this instance, I point out that you ask a question that cannot be answered and that I don't think you should believe in anything. That is my connection to your post.\n\nYou reply that you *will not* believe this shit. The connection to my post just isn't there.

If I were to take a guess, I think it sounds a lot like "Old Hag Syndrome". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis It happens to a lot of people, and if you don't know what is happening it can be quite scary! One of my friends thought he was being attacked by a demon (He wasn't paralyzed, he usually felt like something was either sitting on his chest, or just holding him down) and always saw this scary inhuman entity staring malevolently at him. After he read the link above he said it reminded him a lot of his situation. If your gf is having sleep issues already, it doesn't seem a stretch that this condition accompanied it.\n\nI'm obviously only guessing based on the evidence and my personal experience; a sleep study would help a lot to figure out what is going on. There are a lot of things that could be causing sleep walking, another of my friends had apnea, and this condition caused him to stop breathing repeatedly throughout the night, constantly leaving REM before he could get any real sleep and caused HIS sleep walking episodes. This condition is very dangerous because he STOPPED BREATHING REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. I haven't a clue what could be causing your girlfriend's sleep walking- there are MANY possibilities, she just might be extra stressed or any number of reasons. I only mention his case because in some cases it can point to a more dangerous health condition, though I hope not. Best to the both of you!	1335309463
&gt;It's a reference to my original post, along with your suggestion that the Nazca lines are evidence of aerial craft.\n\nNone the less the point I made with regard to this still stands.\n\n&gt; No. You made claims to truth and referenced Sitchin and Däniken as supporting evidence, who are authors. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about your references.\n\nYes.  I get this.  I get that you're not talking about me.  Again, however, the point I made still stands that I or ANYBODY who has valid information and then gets that valid information undermined by virtue of their not having some sort of scholastic, academic credentials, absolutely misses the forest for the trees.  If the information is valid - from me or *anyone* - then it doesn't matter what the individual's credentials are.\n\n&gt; It's akin to taking cancer treatment advice from a car mechanic instead of a doctor.\n\nlol.  That's actually really a funny statement.  Look up Edgar Cayce.\n\n&gt; It is not an appeal to authority to consider claims with supporting evidence more valid than claims without supporting evidence.\n\nBut I was then and am now referring to the latter, not the former - so I don't know why you felt the need to make mention of "claims without supporting evidence".	1343768796

Seriously,...? That **possible explanation** has been shown to be hearsay numerous times by numerous people since the late 90s.\n\n\nLook at the frikin source FFS,..**.the memo repeats a single newspaper story which was repeated to Guy Hottel by an Air Force investigator who read the story,...That news story draws from the account of a Rudy Fick, a local used car dealer. Fick got the story from a two men, I. J. Van Horn and Jack Murphy, they got the story from,... a radio station advertising manager named George Koehler. Koehler got the story from Silas Newton,...and his accomplice, Leo A. Gebauer. Newton and Gebauer were peddling “doodlebugs” – devices that could supposedly find oil, gas, gold, or anything else that the target of the con was interested in finding**.\n\n\nNow why would that tale ever strike anyone as dubious,...?\n\n\nI find it very telling that Linda Moulton Howe was the last person to take this BS memo and run with it back in 98,...and she still doesnt understand to this day why its important to vett a source before running with it,...\n\nand even TODAY I see this frikin story still making the rounds on MSM(CNN) with the news casters none the wiser,...Purposeful propagation of disinformation,....for shame MSM,...and shame on anyone who needs verification that this memo adds up to anything other than hearsay,...	1302629423

Sounds like dysmenorrhea, if it's that severe. Assuming you've seen a doctor, you've probably been prescribed a combined oral contraceptive, ya?\n\nIf so, does it help? There's some information in the literature I have access to that says it should, but I've not had the opportunity to ask any patients directly.\n\nIf not, consider seeing a doctor. There's some evidence that suggests that birth control will help control that pain with minimal side effects (unless... you know, you're predisposed for a clotting disorder). If not that, there's some other courses that they can prescribe, like a COX-2 inhibitor, that will dull the pain.	1329979896

Sorry if that seemed like a silly question. Half the people in my family, including myself, go by our middle names, so I never assume someone's first name is the name they go by.\n\n All names are fair game to me, which can be confusing these days, as I am receiving a rash of birth announcements, you know, "Asher Sebastian [Surname]" and [Isabella Marie [Surname]" and "Neelima Pooja Saraswati [Surname]" and am never confident to say "And how is little baby [whatever]?" until I hear or see someone else refer to it by name first. Though 9 times out of 10 it's the first name.\n\nOf course sometimes the flow doesn't go right so you have to position the name you want to actually use secondary to the other name, like in my case, "Mary Meghan". "Meghan Mary" is just unnatural. So I've lived my life answering to multiple names. \n\nIt's somewhat of an interesting saga, since we're talking names: \n\n* I'm "Mary" at doctor's offices (which i'm at all the time) and the first time I meet anyone on official business\n\n* I was "Meghan" till I got to college\n\n* then, because there were 3 Meg(h)ans in my college at Rice, I shortened it to "Meg"\n\n* THEN, and about the same time, my toddler cousins dubbed me "Noonie", which is what I've been called by my family for the last 15 years\n\n* then I got married and didn't want to give up my maiden name completely, but couldn't drop my middle name, so my maiden name was added to my middle name, so now my legal first and last names are names I've never before gone by, while my middle name is the first and last name I grew up with:\n\n "Mary - Meghan [Maiden] - [Married Surname]\n\n* I'm conventionally "Mary [Married Surname]" with the middle name "Meghan [Maiden Surname]". \n\n* But I go by "Meg [Married Surname]".\n\n* Little tip: It's super easy to legally change your middle and last names, but for some reason, you have to go before a judge to get your *first* name changed. I don't see the reasoning *at all* but something to consider when naming your child. \n\n* Bonus Fun Fact: I was this close to being named after my father, but they decided they didn't want two people with the same name causing confusion. His name is Stobie. NOBODY IS NAMED STOBIE. \n\n* My husband won't let me name any our potential children Stobie, despite my heart being set on it.	1349835400

I don't know if pulling that quote out on someone religious would have any traction. The religious person could equally say that they gain their moral teaching from the bible (however misguided this might be). So if they trust this moral teaching, then their faith may allow them to trust further the other assertions the bible makes. And just as that quote says 'I trust the consensus of scientists', the believer could say 'I trust the consensus of church members.'	1295978077

It does imply association, but only if there's a reasonable underlying hypothesis.\n\nFor example, if I find a strong correlation between the dose of a drug and the effect of a drug, that makes sense.\n\nIn my case, my chart is bunk because I don't have any reasonable hypothesis to explain my results. All I did was data mine until I found an interesting pattern. My chart is extremely misleading, but that's the point: pseudo-scientists do this all the time.	1355340139
