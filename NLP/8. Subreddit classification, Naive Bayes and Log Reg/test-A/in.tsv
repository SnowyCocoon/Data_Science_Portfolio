Not at all. Reality either behaves in some way or it doesn't. Our politics, beliefs, and opinions do not change it in any way. If you have questions surrounding the science of AGW, then raise them, and if they can't be properly addressed, you have reason to be doubt the theory. If you don't have any such questions, then you are basing your world view around your political beliefs rather than empirical evidence.  \n\nEDIT: I wasn't going to include information specifically about global warming, because I was trying to make a point about not letting politics influence how you validate claims. However, two minutes of searching lead me to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/h8hks/how_solid_is_the_scientific_backing_for/), which has a pretty good top comment.	1331234310

I'm not super certain that they were *definitely* imitating another culture, but it seems that they very well may have been indeed.\n\nJust playing devil's advocate, btw.\n\nAdditionally, if these are indeed homo sapien sapiens that used skull binding techniques on themselves and if this skull binding was an attempt at imitating (presumably very advanced) ETs, I'm not super certain that these very advanced ETs even *left* anything other than some possible artifacts behind.  I'm not certain any actual specimens would indeed be eventually unearthed.\n\nAnd if they *were*, I doubt TPTB would not have immediately sequestered the data and kept it from the public.  They tend to do that kind of thing often, unfortunately.\n\nLots of conditions here, but I think the ultimate point is that this archeological finding is indeed very interesting.	1355780381

Be careful. Some de-programmers forcibly abduct and use the same psychological tactics as cults to bring cultists back to the larger culture. They can be even more violent than the cults themselves.\n\nPeople don't end up believing in cults because the message makes sense to them, they end up in cults because of the psychological and emotional environment they provide. Your friend of a friend probably fell into a cult because of some emotional lack. I mention this because it's useless to try to reason someone out of a cult, but you can perhaps identify what they get out of it and work from that angle.	1353085508

&gt;the presenters' gambit was clear enough: Can anyone really prove the earth isn't  sitting still? That's tougher than it sounds: Even though astrophysicists tell us that every body in the universe is in motion, it will always appear that the thing you're on is standing still relative to everything else.\n\nGeocentrism is actually a valid frame of reference, just not a very useful one when describing anything further away than Earth's orbit. And if your evidence is that while we're on Earth, everything seems to move around us, then you could make a similar argument for anywhere else being the center of the universe. If I'm standing on Mars, then it seems like everything moves around Mars.	1300305149

&gt;You claim that my MP3 player interferes with airplane electronics? Show me.\n\nI worked as an electromagnetic compatibility engineer, so I  have seen many examples of these interferences.  To provide an example, I tested a pump used to create vacuum that holds on prosthetic limbs.  During initial testing, we learned that it was susceptible to a common cell phone frequency, that would result in lack of pumping and, by extension, the prosthetic would fall off.  \n\nA much more common and easy to grasp EMC issue is static discharge.  That stuff is a bitch...\n\nBut make no mistake, RF interference is very real. \n\nThey don't disallow electronics because they KNOW they will cause issues.  They disallow them because they KNOW there is a POTENTIAL to cause issues.  	1335213558

I think compulsory vaccination is out of line when it comes to vaccines that have not been tested long term or are being used in new combinations such as the MMR vaccine linked above.\n\nIt turned out that the chicken pox and MMR vaccines, on their own, were perfectly safe and effective, but when used in conjunction with each other caused seizures in 1 out of 2,300 shots. \n\nSo now the CDC says "hey guys, you might want to separate those two shots..." but that comes as little consolation to the parents of kids who ended up with seizures.\n\nThe BIG problem I have are the folks who go "Jenny McCarthy is bullshit" when they don't take the time to do the research and see that there are, in fact, problems with quite a few vaccinations.\n\nAre thy all bad? No. But they aren't all good either. 	1330065921
Pennsylvania has a possible UFO crash in Kecksburg, about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.

Congelier Mansion, 1129 Ridge Avenue:\nhttp://pittsburgh.about.com/od/history/a/congelier_house.htm\n\n"When officials entered the house to investigate, they found a decomposed female body strapped to the bed and five headless young women in basement graves.

Given that a number of long-practising, high-level Tibetan Buddhist monks have willingly involved themselves in a long-running and careful investigation of the neurophysiology of meditation with extremely interesting results, I have no issue whatsoever with the idea that 'mystical' practice can deliver real psychological and physiological benefits. \n\nHowever, since the scientists in question have been able to measure and learn about these responses, and since the Buddhists monks themselves have been happy to participate, I take issue with the idea that the scientific standpoint won't provide similar benefits.\n\nAbout the only advantage to be had in practicing with a non-scientific, "I believe" approach would be the placebo effect. And there, of course, you win, because the placebo effect remains one of the great mysteries of science today. (Go ahead. Google up 'top ten mysteries of science'.) \n\nIs it worth practicing without science in order to obtain that effect? I have no idea. Nor can I ever test for myself, since I'm aware of the placebo effect, and any practice I undertake will be coloured by that knowledge.\n\nFor what it's worth, I practice zazen, kyudo and iaido. 	1321135489

&gt; Whether something is homeopathic or not is not related to the dilution but to the fact that Samuel Hahnemann decided (with no evidence whatsoever) that an element or compound that caused a particular symptom could be used to cure that symptom - "like cures like".\n\nRight, but as far as I'm aware, there is no homeopathic claim that zinc *causes* cold symptoms. So it isn't, in the traditional sense, a homeopathic remedy. It is merely a mildly diluted medicinal. Which doesn't actually work even at full strength. I didn't really make that clear, though, so I can understand how you would think I was focusing on the dilution.	1325739379

Yes, unfortunately, the left seems to be more susceptible to ridiculous new age woo, but lets no forget the right has no problem at all believing in story books with talking snakes and deity blood sacrifices, upon which they try to legislate.\n\nThe leftist Democrat brain image was hideously petty and had nothing to do with what would otherwise be really good points.\n\nWith the anti-leftist nonsense, there also was a sense (as always with anti-leftist nonsense) of anti-intellectualism.

1) Actually, confirmed by French Intelligence.\n\n2) Granted he doesn't directly cite a source regarding the dialysis. The intention of this link was to show that OBL was clearly very ill in 02.\n\n3)\n&gt;The recording was dismissed by the Bush administration yesterday as sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al-Qa'eda leader was already dead.\n\nUh, kind of a big deal. The Bush Administration changed their story regarding whether or not OBL was dead or alive.\n\n4) You got me, I thought that article had a line in it that doesn't appear to be there.\n\n5) Why do you believe Other U.S. officials over Musharraf?\n\n6)\n&gt;GUPTA: You can look [at pictures from a December 2001 video] and notice that he has what some doctors refer to as sort of a frosting over of his features -- his sort of grayness of beard, his paleness of skin, very gaunt sort of features. A lot of times people associate this with chronic illness. Doctors can certainly look at that and determine some clinical features.\n&gt;But even more than that, it's sometimes possible to differentiate the specific type of disease or illness that he may be suffering from. The sort of frosting of the appearance is something that people a lot of times associate with chronic kidney failure, renal failure, certainly someone who is requiring dialysis would have that.\n&gt;He's also not moving his arms. I looked at this tape all the way through its entire length. He never moved his left arm at all. The reason that might be important is because people who have had a stroke -- and certainly people are at increased risk of stroke if they also have kidney failure -- he may have had a stroke and therefore is not moving his left side. And in the rest of the videotape, he does move his right side a little bit more than he does his left. So those are some of the things that are sort of "of note" here in this more recent videotape. \n\n7) Why do you think Karzai is a 'guy who doesn't really know?' Who is a guy who really knows?\n\n8) Granted he has no evidence, but it is worth noting that initially in 02, you've got US Officials going around saying OBL is probably dead.\n\n9) Perhaps you could explain to me why you think this is a joke.\n\nExplain to me how anything that is going on now can actually be verified as anything more than a rumor. It was just as much in the US's interest to change the story from 'OBL is probably dead' to 'Bin Laden is still alive' to justify their actions in Afghanistan and Pakistan as it was for the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan to claim he's dead, so you can't just disqualify one and not disqualify the other.	1304393289

I hope you're not implying that downvotes are simply because your opinion dissents. According to the reddiquette\n\n&gt;Vote.

Whatever their next project is, I hope it's better than their stint on Discovery channel. I've only seen season 1 as that's all Netflix has to offer on them, but they certainly weren't nearly in-depth enough with their investigations, didn't capture much evidence, used flashlights and normal camera mode when they clearly had night-vision cameras available.... The generic "Discovery channel southwestern country music" soundtrack didn't help either.\n\nI mean, it isn't *terrible*. You could certainly do **far** worse as far as paranormal shows go (Paranormal State, Dead Files). Honestly, like 'em or not, I think Ghost Adventures has the format right for paranormal investigation television shows. **Only** cameras are the ones the three investigators are carrying and some static cameras they've set up; no external camera crew or fancy "cinematic" camera angles or fake interlacing lines that serve no purpose but to make the whole thing look fake (see: Paranormal State, Dead Files). A bit less "mess around, see place" at the beginning and a bit more "show the damn investigation and evidence", and you've got a perfect format.\n\nSorry, think I got a bit off topic there. Also, considering the show seems to have been canceled, I wonder if they're going to continue showing their investigations through some other medium?	1324414244

Pretty much.  There's something of a grey area between elective surgery, which is not emergent, and true emergency surgery.  For example, malignant tumor excision is pretty time-critical, but at the same time, scheduled in advance.

The Watson apologists seem to have missed the point. Dawkins never said other women had it worse so shut up. What he did was compare suffering (Muslima) to non-suffering (Watson). \n\nIf women don't feel safe just being in lifts with men, then isn't the issue *what we're telling our girls about men?* \n\nWhy are we telling men that they must adjust their behaviour to cater to irrational fears rather than raising girls to be aware that (1) most molestations happen from people you *know well* and (2) most men won't assault you? Why are we raising girls with fear when no benefit will accrue from it?\n\nThe feminists who have turned this into a gender battle just look ridiculous at this point. You're allowed to approach people you like respectfully; and even ask them out for for coffee. What you're not allowed to do is use force and harass after you've been told no. Since this guy did none of these things, no harm no fowl. Watson's persecution exists in her own head predicated on a delusion about men. 	1310024883

Beautiful hypocrisy, claiming that I have attempted character assassination and then go on to say that I must be some sort of "religious conservative" to bring /r/politics in to the discussion -- and that I have an inferiority complex.\n\nEither way, I said I'll gladly take my leave because I don't like /r/atheism and its tendencies to circlejerk and blame religion as the source for all the problems they can semi-reasonably point a finger at. Like your original post. Sure, it's easy to say that religion causes a lack of innovation, which causes a decrease of education, which increases poverty, etc. But like most issues concerning a country it is never just one cause.\n\nYou also misinterpreted what I said about atheists from /r/atheism coming here because they feel like they're superior. That is to say that they feel like they're too good to circlejerk in /r/atheism and have to do it in other subreddits where it's not wanted. /r/skeptic in this case. A decent amount of subs here are atheists and agnostic. If I got angry from ideas that come from skepticism I probably would not be here.\n\nAlso, I bring up /r/politics and /r/atheism up because that's nearly all you ever post to, at least in the past 8 months. Which might be why you felt like it was appropriate to circlejerk here as well. In truth, I'm not religious not am I conservative, I just don't like having to listen to spew from an unverified image made by a poster with intentions of making a point rather than analyzing the words from the image, like what usually happens.\n\nSometimes an image makes rounds on the internet, someone sees it, posts to /r/skeptic, and then the collective group of subscribers here break it down in order to figure out how much "truth" there is to the image, graph, article, etc. But that's not what you came here to do. You came here, to make a post with an straight-faced title of: "Islam is actually the major reason why people are protesting embassies violently, but people are reluctant to admit it." and then proceed to argue the point throughout the post.\n\nAnd probably the worst thing is that you do the same sort of "logic'd" arguing that places like /r/magicskyfairy and /r/bravetheism make fun of /r/atheism for. -- The comment I'm replying to is full of "logic'd"\n\nEither way, I'm too tired to keep arguing with people over the internet, gonna go back to discussing lore in /r/Darksouls and stay there.	1347787585
Yet there it is. As mentioned, it doesn't make sense to assume the even more unlikely. We have seen that humans can build stuff, and have done so for many years. That's what we have to work with, untill at least some evidence ties aliens with the pyramids or other similar monuments. There's not any, aside from a few hieroglyphs that **might** or might not look like a depiction of advanced technology not availible at that time. \n\n\nPersonally I think that the pyramids was built over a far greater period than the suggested 20 years and that an astonishing number of people worked on it almost without cease. But, for now we can only guess.	1327365734

Wow, the people on that thread are being huge assholes. Seriously, she invited people to a thing, and then people went through and downvoted all her comments, including the ones defending herself and the festival after being called out unfairly.\n\n&gt;As mafoo said, your wellness festival shouldn't lie to people about what is healthy. You're effectively telling people \n\nShe's not telling anyone anything. It's not her festival.\n\n&gt;but this is a festival that essentially celebrates and promotes ignorance and fear of science.\n\nThat's just inflammatory, regardless of the follow up caveats in subsequent posts. Following the "church" example quoted elsewhere, someone puts out an invitation to a Sunday Baptist church, and you're going to go and say that it's an evil religion that hates gays and not expect her to want to talk about all the good stuff involved, and then tell her she's taking things personally?\n\nThis is straight up trolling douchebaggery. You and the other posters on there should be ashamed of yourselves for going out of your way on R/BROOKLYN to mock this girl's simple invitation. She didn't come into r/skeptic, she didn't ask for opinions on the contents of the event. She put up a fucking event notice on a local subreddit. If you REALLY want to be an asshole, just downvote it. You don't need to go through goading her into comments and karma bombing the whole fucking post. Christ people like you make me angry.

That PDF file you referenced actually concludes that the government officials operated by the book and weren't under any undue influence from Searle.  It's kind of strange that you would include that here.\n\nThose other sites are wrong.  And there's no doubt that they're wrong because this is a matter of public record.  The Public Board Of Inquiry did have concerns about the Searle tests, but what they said was that further study was needed. \n\nArthur Hays did convened a panel exactly as he was supposed to, and that panel went over some new Japanese research which showed Aspartame not to cause cancer. If it can be said that he "overruled" the Public Board Of Inquiry, it's only in the sense that any decision to proceed with caution can be "overruled" when new evidence and proper procedure allow for it.\n\nThere was no "internal FDA team" advising Hayes not to approve Aspartame. Had the Public Board Of Inquiry had the Japanese data at the time, they would have approved Aspartame earlier.  Hayes decision was supported by the previous Public Board Of Inquiry, and Hayes didn't face widespread internal disagreement from FDA scientists on the issue as suggested.	1330196206

I hold no particular opinion on climate change; I'm not qualified to. Though it is doubtless the Earth has been warming in the recent past, I don't know enough about ice core samples and carbon sequestering in H2O to form an educated opinion. Examining the evidence though, it sure seems like there is a definite correlation between CO2 and global temperature increase.\n\nThat being said, the confirmation of bias (excuse the pun) is worrying. When you're dealing with such supposed massive/global problems, I would like a higher standard of impartiality than any other problem. To be honest, I could give a flying fuck if someone has a bias during an examination of data gathered during a test of general relativity. If it's found right or wrong by further studies, that's what it is. We don't tend to take one study as gospel. Forgive my possible naivete, but from my limited experience it seems like any paper published that agrees with the mainstream view in climate science is welcomed with praise, and any opposing data is dismissed.\n\nEdit: I want to make it clear that I'm not denying anthropogenic climate change here, I'm simply questioning methodologies and biases based upon the Yale study published and the general demographics of scientists. It's an interesting issue to me.	1310551708

**ofthe5thkind** has a great scientific grasp of the facts.\n\nThe problem starts where some people just refuse to accept facts using "god of the gaps" thinking. It usually starts with "well you cant prove this or that" or "we don't know everything". The facts are that it is possible to get to another star but it would be prohibitively expensive in terms of fuel and length.  I for one do not want to get on a ship where I would never see the destination.\n\nSomeone will then say 'well maybe the technology isn't invented yet" the problem with this statement is that you still have to stay within the physical laws of the universe. The "tribesman from the middle of nowhere to explain an aeroplane" didn't have the physics background to explain why the plane flys, modern man and science can and do, and we extrapolate all the time on the future of flight, these same laws and rules apply here and across the universe.\n\nIt boils down to this, where ever we went on earth or the solar system we have left our presence known. Parachutes, landing pads, discarded tools. On earth I defy anyone to go to a past plane crash site and not find something left behind, I have done it and at sites where the military has "scoured" the site to leave nothing behind. That is a joke, when a plane crashes you find crap all over the place for years.\n\nTake any claimed UFO crash site and there isn't anything left - not a speck of paint.\n\nSome try to say that in the late 40s something crashed out west, every one and their mother came out of the woodwork 40 years later and said they handled the debris, and not a single one of them took and hid any of it. Not a bolt or a nut or fleck of paint of this amazing once in a lifetime encounter after seeing truckloads of debris go through all those hands, and 40 years of searching debris fields.\n\nIt comes down to one conclusion, they haven't been here and we aint going there.\n\nSend a radio signal.	1345061832

This much largely all jives with my own views, but what about when one isn't writing for an "outside" audience (the example I used elsewhere was PZ Myers blog, which is popular but rife with insulting language)? I get the impression that perhaps you think as much still "reflects poorly on the community" or some such?\n\nAlso, one element I rarely see discussed is how we are supposed to 'measure dickishness' and determine when this DBAD philosophy is supposed to kick-in. That is, I can't imagine that we are supposed to refrain from saying *anything* that some listener might find offensive (after all, anti-vaxxers don't like it when I remind them that their beliefs lead to the deaths of infants). Any thoughts on this element?	1353374596
My favorite line from the FAQ:\n\nQ:  Why are Sasquatch allowed to gather Tree Octopuses if the octopuses are endangered?\n\nA:  No one allows a Sasquatch to do anything; they just do it.\n\nSasquatch have been gathering Tree Octopuses since before Humans settled in their habitats.

Most early pilgrims brough a christian preacher, and the common cold(used here as general term for various diseases that the pilgrims brought and are immune to). the preacher preached, they usually did not believe him. 60% of the natives die due to the common cold. Most of the survivers convert. Of course pilgrims also died due to local diseases that are alien to them, but the pilgrims are just a few dozen, compared to thousands of natives.\n\nbottom line: first contacts cause conflicts and deaths, but in the process both gain immunity towards each other.

Ha! Well it is a good thing we are having this discussion in r/UFOs and not r/aliens. \n\nBut seriously I haven't said anything about aliens and spacecraft, you have. And well those documents actually do as well. As well as the US documents that have been released, also discuss aliens and spacecraft. But I think that is just speculation. \n\nI don't believe you have done the reading you say you have funkybunch because you sound very I'll informed. I don't think you have even watched the videos or links I have posted because your replies are nonsensical. I think you have already formed your opinion and not interested in looking at the scientific studies that have been made on the available information. If you had read even a tenth of the more than 50,000 pages of reports by military officers around the world trained in identifying aerial phenomena of unidentified flying objects that they believed were unexplainable, then I think you would express your opinion in a different way. It is many of these military officers who use terms like aliens and spacecraft, not me. I have never seen a UFO. I am fascinated by the secrecy around these reports, and the US governments unwillingness to open them up to the public. If they are not hiding anything then tell us what they know. If it is all military black projects then just open up the cases from before 1970. \n\nYou are not interested in being enlightened.

Something I wonder about so-called "psychics," do they really believe they are psychic, or do they actually know better and just stick with the facade no matter what?

I'm in chiropractic med school right now. I am going to one of the more evidence based schools out there. We learn just as much as any medical, dental, podiatry, etc school.  Chiropractic care is safe and very effective. The key word in some other comments is musculoskeletal.  There really isn't any proof, for or against, chiro care helping very many issues outside of muscle and skeleton problems. But if you want relief from tension headaches, back pain, etc, the best option is a chiropractor. There are a lot of other things we do as well, but for the person new to chiropractic, I feel that answer should be okay. 	1312223322

The reason things changed, I suspect, is not because of the general /r/skeptic community, but from readers of her blog who came to this thread and changed things.\n\nI'm not trying to paint this whole subreddit with the same brush, there are many people who have different opinions, but it is sad that many of the people who are on /r/skeptic feel the need to be so anti-feminist, and be so quick to abuse someone like Watson along gender lines.\n\nI'm sure that you and I would agree on far more things than we disagree on, as it is with most of the people on this subreddit, and likely even the general Reddit community. That doesn't mean that when I see the utter crap that I often see on any threads about Watson or feminism in general that I'm not going to call out the male-centric ego-bullshit that is so pervasive in our society at large.\n\nI see gender issues as a major problem in the world, and it's something that I want to see fixed. You're right that this isn't going to come about through name calling and non-constructive criticism. It's important to keep in mind that the way you are seeing Watson in regards to gender issues, is how atheists and skeptics are perceived by the majority of the population. You have a cognitive bias, as do I and everybody else, that when you see someone espousing something you disagree with you are more likely to notice them when they are having a shit day and a bit of a whinge than when they're making well reasoned arguments in support of their cause.\n\nI apologise if got a bit rambling towards the end there.	1325117374

Hold up on the meteor explanation for one second.

I've posted about it here and reported it to mufon so can I ask if you're 100% sure on the meteor explanation?  What we saw was definitely not a meteor as it moved too slow and did not burn up but was a bright, pulsating (not quite neon), green sphere.	1354068370

First, you make a false claim that since Shermer himself believes it, it can't be as absurd as conspiracy theories.  Its an absurd claim because legislation brought an end to child labor.  That's like arguing that the free market brought us the drug war.  There might be some element of truth to it (corporations that sell guns to police officers benefit from it), but it's still kind of specious.\n\nSecond, as I already said, legislation ended child labor.  If capitalism ended child labor, then why is there still so much child labor in places where the market isn't regulated?\n\nMy basic point is that his claim, that the free market brought an end to child labor, is silly.  It is a claim that might be defensible in the narrow sense but is as valid in the broader sense as bigfoots and government conspiracies.  Someone might have interesting evidence that bogfoots exist, but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  Since legislation brought an end to child labor, it would take some extraordinary evidence to make it even worth looking into that the free market really did it.	1310618448

I didn't say "male privilege." That's definitely real, and largely ignored by the MRM. I said "dominant gender roles," which one might rephrase as "the gender narrative." Let's pick a few of the easier-to-explain ones from [the list the OP references](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/uwekw/facts_and_statistics_detailing_male_oppression/) to show how they're caused by the underlying assumptions that society makes about each gender.\n\n&gt;Men comprise 95% of workplace deaths.\n\nBecause men tend to work more dangerous jobs, because employers see women as too fragile and incapable of handling the dangerous jobs and see men as more resistant to such injuries.\n\n&gt;Men commit suicide at over triple the rate that women do.\n\nBecause men are seen as stoic and unemotional, their mental health needs are not met. This is the direct foil to the idea that women are hysterical and constant emotional wrecks.\n\n&gt;Parental rights. Men have virtually none.\n\nBecause women are seen as having a single role -- parenting -- that overrides everything else and makes them inherently better at it than men.\n\n&gt;On some airlines, men were banned from sitting next to kids on airplanes, simply because they were men. Why? Because men are pedophiles, obviously. This ban remains on some airlines, such as Air New Zealand.\n\nAgain, an outgrowth of gender stereotypes of men (as almost purely sexually-motivated beings) and women (as nurturing individuals incapable of harming a child) alike.\n\n&gt;Selective service. Enough said\n\nAgain, men are big and tough and can take the rigors of combat/military training, women are seen as too fragile, unreliable, and distracting to function in a combat situation.	1345142722

Anyone see the study mentioned in the comments?\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18204390.1\n\n&gt;Objective: To investigate associations between chiropractic visits and vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stroke and to contrast this with primary care physician (PCP) visits and VBA stroke.\n\n&gt;Results: There were 818 VBA strokes hospitalized in a population of more than 100 million person-years. In those aged &lt;45 years, cases were about three times more likely to see a chiropractor or a PCP before their stroke than controls. Results were similar in the case control and case crossover analyses. There was no increased association between chiropractic visits and VBA stroke in those older than 45 years. Positive associations were found between PCP visits and VBA stroke in all age groups. Practitioner visits billed for headache and neck complaints were highly associated with subsequent VBA stroke.\n\n&gt; Conclusion: VBA stroke is a very rare event in the population. The increased risks of VBA stroke associated with chiropractic and PCP visits is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from VBA dissection seeking care before their stroke. We found no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to primary care.	1337180318

I think you misunderstood, I agree with you 100%. My thesis is promoting socialism at some level.

Okay, I see what your original question was about.\n\nBy the way, do you off-hand know of a source for the "double CO2 in concentration, the temperature of the system will rise by about 1 degree" claim?  I'd like to read that.  I'm not questioning it's validity, but I need to see how that was arrived at before I can try to reason about why we might see more warming than that.\n\nAs a possible example of why, if that number comes from a basic thermodynamic "black box" calculation, then there's a pretty big non-feedback answer: increasing greenhouse gas will warm lower atmosphere and cool upper atmosphere (in the absence of convection, but even with convection you'll see some of this effect happening, it's just blunted). So the total energy gain actually gets concentrated in the lower atmosphere, and there's an additional energy balance shift from the upper to the lower.\n\n(Also, preferably a source that's not from a climate denier blog or something. Sorry to have to make this disclaimer, but I'm so fucking sick of Watts' dishonest shit right now... I guess as long as its a reasonable post, lacking in polemic shit, I could handle it...)	1261069059

You may be interested in reading some of the books by dolores cannon - perhaps "the three waves of volunteers and the new earth" or "the convoluted universe" series. She does past life regressions and weaves the stories into books. Obviously if you think the concepts are BS then no need to go any further. Still she is able to get many consistent stories from lots of different people. \n\nThe general theme is that this world is going to go through a huge transition and lots of souls have chosen to come here and assist in various ways. Some of the ways are as aliens who are acting as witnesses and also helping balance earth energy, other ways are to incarnate on earth and actually be "feet on the ground".\n\nIf you feel a connection then you may have had a sleep paralysis experience which would be typical of "alien" concept.\n\nAlso the idea of "aliens" may be misleading. It has been suggested that in some cases it may be a future version of yourself in a ship, making passive (because they cannot be active) types of responses. Or they may other members of your soul family acting as your support system. \n\nIn any case, big changes are to happen within the next decade. Things are appearing to speed up in some regards. Will be interesting to see what the future brings.	1345265510

For example, testing the stealth capability of the F-117 no doubt involved many flybys past many different radar systems to verify it was consistently difficult to detect.  How, exactly, is one supposed to reproduce a one-off "close encounter" radar anecdote?  It's not evidence, it's arm-waving.\n\nAs for the dragon, that's from chapter 10 of Carl Sagan's *The Demon-Haunted World*.  It serves as a hypothetical example of a non-falsifiable claim, where every proposed test of the claim is deflected with excuses as to how each test is unfair or does not apply.  As Sagan said in that chapter, "Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder."  Hence Neil's advice to swipe some gadget the next time one finds oneself aboard a UFO.  And what did you do?  You immediately came up with a handy excuse for the next yokel who claims to have been abducted; 'their technology kept me from taking anything!' 	1312344331

I saw a different promo today for the show. I was home and just happened to have the Dr. Oz show on in the background, as the show comes on right before the noon news where I live.\n\nIt was a promo for a show on "alternative medicine" very similar to the one linked to. There was a quick flash of Dr. Novella's face (apparently in mid breath, which seemed like a cheap shot) and then Dr. Oz going "Why are you afraid of alternative medicine?!" in a rather condescending tone. It also had some rather ominous music.\n\nI'm scared this will be a hack editing job in which Dr. Novella is made to look like "the bad guy". 	1303529728
I'm head off to work at this time i will try to answer question on my phone. \n\nyeah i blew off most of the orbs as dust, however a lot of the times i would take pictures and you could see the dust from the flash yet nothing would turn up on the film. Also, i've had this camera for over 4 years and taken thousands of pictures and never caught anything like orbs or mist until we did these investigations.\n\nWe heard several noises, from growls to shouting and screaming (although those could have been people), lots of experiences with temperature drops and cold chills. I'll try to upload the EVPs today.\n\nThanks i love progressive rock! :)\n	1345040150
No, you're right, and I agree totally when it's done safely and legally.  I actually thought about this thread last night.\n\nIt was dark our, and my family and I were waiting in the left-turn lane at a light at a busy intersection.  A cyclist was on the sidewalk on the opposing-traffic side of the street, facing the same direction we were.\n\nOur left-turn light turned green, and I started to go, and make my left onto the busy street.  I noticed, as I turned, that that cyclist had started riding through the intersection, despite the "don't walk" sign, and no green light for straight-bound traffic (he wasn't turning with me)...and he had to slow down to avoid running into me.  Sure, I wasn't going very fast, but his move was illegal, unsafe, and unwise.  That's all I meant.\n\nCheers.\n	1349034849

But let's say factory farms can raise more cows per acre than organic farms, a reasonable assumption. This also means that they have more food in one location when they go to ship it, and can probably use more efficient shipping methods. Is this enough to make up for the difference in corn vs. grass fed? I have absolutely no idea. It's never as simple as just saying organic is better than factory, or factory is better than organic. Both have pros and cons, and you need to look at the whole system if you want to make a strong judgement.	1311724128

My issue with pareidolia is that it's such an easy blanket explanation for any photographs or items that have a possible human image in them. Not saying it isn't a valid phenomenon, but it's just too easy to go "Oh that, that's not a face, that's just pareidolia".  Which is essentially saying "Yeah, I see the face, but I refuse to believe that I see the face".	1327680747

I'm glad I'm not the only one who's confused by this. It's not that I don't think alien life doesn't exist. I can definitely see intelligent life being out there (based on the size of the universe I'd say it's almost guaranteed). It's just that the incomprehensibly massive distances between us and other potential life-bearing planets combined with the inability to travel faster than light render the chances of said intelligent life ever running into us to be incredibly small. \n\nAdditionally, some have proposed the possibility that there may be a very short maximum time span (say, several thousand years) in which most sufficiently advanced civilizations would be at the appropriate technological level (before they collapse, etc). At the very least, the timespan of an individual species' survival would be a limiting factor. That makes the chances of two civilizations both in the butter zone crossing paths even more teeny tiny.\n\nThat said, I don't think SETI should disappear. I just think it's overly optimistic...	1306712663

I agree that many are genuinely suffering--I just don't think there's any evidence to suggest that it's environmentally de novo. If you'd like, I will pull [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17137865) for you when I am at work tomorrow and can access journals. It is a meta-analysis, which examines all the studies on a topic over a course of time, takes into accounts the different results, and pieces together conclusions based on methodological differences (not just strengths and weaknesses). In the conclusion of this meta-analysis (which are incredibly in depth), they state "We conclude that persons with MCS do react to chemical challenges; however, these responses occur when they can discern differences between active and sham substances, suggesting that the mechanism of action is not specific to the chemical itself and might be related to expectations and prior beliefs."\n\nWhat this means is that they show their reaction when they are able to determine what is placebo and what is not--not that they are reacting to any specific chemical trigger.\n\nIt sounds like you know someone or a few people who suffer, and I don't mean to impugn their misery, or them themselves, but I really want to caution you against taking anectdotal evidence, and evidence to which you are close in proximity, to heart. I think I know the point you're making, but I don't see evidence to support it. The evidence I see is either entirely inconclusive, or suggests that there is a significant psychological component. \n\nRegarding enzyme function, you can see go/no-go situations, but given that this seems to be a "sensitivity" issue, you would expect a range of seriousness of symptoms. You would also expect to see a grouping of chemicals, rather than "some people are sensitive to x, others to y," with no discernible pattern. You are probably correct in the polarized sampling bias in media coverage.\n\nThe one study that suggested something, was one that I criticized (it was the fMRI study). It implicated an olfactoric dysfunction. Perhaps their nocioception is somehow skewed? This would imply the effects are not toxic, but rather that they are sensitized towards some sort of olfactoric neuropathy. If this is the case, I would have expected there to be similar cases going much much farther back.\n\nIf it were an odor hypersensitivity, then it would be clearly legitimate (and perhaps suggest a route of treatment), but the etiology (cause of a pathology, or disease) would be entirely different than what is being suggested (in terms of the culprit). This explanation, if it were borne out, would demonstrate the worth of pursuing research (I'm never for ignoring anything, no matter how dull, and this is an interesting phenomenon), and would also demonstrate the danger of jumping to conclusions, or speculating without evidence.\n\nIf you do ever come across an article on MCS (or anything else) in a journal somewhere, and can't access it, send me a message and I'll be happy to pull it for you.\n\nIn any case, it really has been nice chatting with you. I think you are definitely right about the media, by the way.\n	1316494545

Well if this piddly paper is enough to convince her of the existence of a pervasive quantum magic field, then surely she also believes in UFOs, bigfoot, unicorns, Jesus, dragons, ancient aliens, Allah, miracles, saints, faith healing, homeopathy, Reiki, past lives, hauntings, and demonic possession too, right? Every one of the above has *at least* as much evidence as is presented for said quantum magic field. Draw up a list of ridiculous stuff that people believe and go through it item by item.\n\nMy fundamental problem with "the supernatural" is that it's a big hodge-podge of shitty evidence and it can't *all* be true, so if your bar of evidence required is low enough to include a belief in reincarnation, it also has to be low enough to include a whole host of other things. That is, of course, assuming your beliefs are based on evidence. I don't care if you want to believe in magic, but don't waste everyone else's time by pretending that you believe in magic because of good evidence for it. How better to force someone to admit this than to confront them with equally worthy evidence for a wide range of bullshit?	1334677777

After doing some light research on this, the only people who seem to support gluten intolerance caused by anything but Coeliac's disease are people trying to sell a book about how to live gluten free. If, statistically speaking, you can only sell a book to between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people, I guess you have to find some way to inflate that number if you really want to make a profit.\n\nI would not be surprised if eating really excessive amounts of gluten could contribute to existing digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel and acid reflux, but both of those conditions are resolved completely with balanced diets, medication and/or stress reduction. \n\nThe *dummies* book on Gluten sensitivity actually implies that you can develop Coeliac disease through exposure to gluten, ala Diabetes. Except gluten sensitivity is a genetic disorder. You're either predisposed to it, or you're not. Early exposure may determine whether or not it develops, but eating six pieces of toast and a bowl of rice for breakfast every morning when you're 30 isn't going to suddenly make your stomach start attacking Gluten.\n\n	1329081882

Really, this should have been coupled with the bit about Wikipedia, and told people to just to go straight to the references section to get a good idea.\n\n&gt;Extra Credit: Visit Your Local Library and Consult Librarians and Reference Materials\n\n? Not sure how this is reputable.  \n\n---\n\nUnless I missed it, they really should have drilled down on the looking for what people have to gain, their credentials, their other works, whether they're just a "contribute" or an actual expert, etc. \n\nFor example, David McRaney (an expert cited by LifeHacker) of http://youarenotsosmart.com/, \n\n&gt;David McRaney is a journalist who loves psychology, technology and the Internet.\n\n&gt;Before going to college, he tried waiting tables, working construction, selling leather coats, building and installing electrical control panels, and owning pet stores.\n\n&gt;As a journalist, McRaney cut his teeth covering Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast and in the Pine Belt for several newspapers. Since then he has been a beat reporter, an editor, a photographer and everything in between.\n\n&gt;He is now employed as director of new media for a broadcast television company where he also produced a television show focusing on the music of the Deep South.\n\n&gt;He is married to Amanda McRaney, and they live in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.\n\nwarrants some skepticism on his authority other than his obvious enthusiasm. Not saying you should write him off, but that bio certainly makes me incredulous. 	1340226154
Well, so far they've been healthy debates.  I respect him to much to let it go further than that.  It's not really that I want to prove atheism to him, because I don't believe I could ever succeed at that.  I just want him to understand my position and explain to him why I'll never be "coming around".   And I want to do it in a way that is convincing enough to get the point across short from saying, "Quit bothering me about this".\n\n&gt; If you're trying to learn about what he believes in and compare it to your own beliefs, however, carry forth and be honest.\n\nThis is exactly what I'd like to do, while making him understand that I'm not going to change as I stated before.  I'm sure my wording in how I express my feelings doesn't come across the way I want it to.  I don't try to convince him of anything, only show him what I think and why.  If I somehow implied that he wouldn't have solid ideas on his faith, I didn't meant to.  He has great conviction and in his mind he **knows** what he believes is real.  There's no changing his beliefs and I wouldn't try.  I only want to state my beliefs in a more poignant manner.	1303158856

There are definitely correlations between movements/gestures/expressions and emotional states, but they are not absolute. This means that things will not always mean the same thing from one moment to the next, and individual people will vary from one to the other. You can identify trends, but those are useless on an individual basis because you can't know in advance how much that person's mannerisms align with the trend. I would say that such observations are perfectly scientific, but using them to make predictions is overreaching. 	1338397374

&gt;But the claims by the religious happen to be inside the realm of science\n\nDo you mind elaborating?  I am honestly curious as to how they fall within the realm of science.

This reminds me of my great grandmother whom I was very close with. She always gave me pennies or something whenever I went to her house.

This sounds good in theory. However, in practice, most people less educated in a subject do not seem to follow this.

You argue to convince people around you, not necessarily your opponent. 	1346599152
I know it surprised me when I figured out I like Doctor Thunder better than Dr. Pepper.\n\nAs to your bond splitting speculation..interesting. I would like to add: the scientists in the Atlantic study, if pressed, would add a "....probably" on the end of everything they have *ever* published; we don't know *exactly* how the Human Body does anything. HFCS could be the cause of male pattern baldness; Raw Cane Sugar could extend your lifespan by 1 day per tablespoon consumed. or vice versa.	1344872036
It differentiates from religious humanists, who think, if I understand correctly, that most religions are outmoded, so they decided to make their own. (I'm fuzzy on the details).\n\nHowever, Wikipedia tells me that "Humanism" refers to the Humanist "life view" or whatever which is basically the same as secular humanism. So you are probably correct about its redundancy.	1315121546
&gt; Does anyone see any hope, or are we going to be drowned in homeopathy, copper bracelets, iridology, and ancient aliens?\n\nI've kicked around these thoughts for a while.  I think we are running into some cultural blockades.  The crowds who bump around with the bracelets, homoeopathy and what not tend to live in a positive culture of 'Yes.'  Skeptics tend to run in a negative culture of 'WTF!!? -No!"\n\nSo the question is, do the benefits of living in a positive, affirming 'Yes' oriented culture outweigh the benefits of living in a negative 'No' debunking culture?  Unless, you are praying your kids to death, I suspect that the costs of a $60 bracelet, or the occasional homoeopathic cold remedy is so minor that they would rather live in a magical world.\n\n&lt;Devil's Advocate&gt; So what if someone really believes in ghosts?  Or ancient alien ancestors? The negative impact on their daily lives is negligible to non-existent. And on the plus side, they are culturally seen as quirky, fun and interesting. &lt;/Devil's Advocate&gt;\n\nI think for reason and logic to win out, we have to find a way as a skeptic culture to come across as more positive and fun.  I know this though may grate against many of you, but this is essentially an advertising point and we are losing the advertising war.\n\nPerhaps, instead of telling people all of the time what doesn't work, we start offering more positive solutions as to what really does work! We need to find a way to come across as more positive.\n\nIt's a tough nut to crack, but I think we need to rethink our public image and how we come across to people.	1335101490

&gt; Humans are used in experiments testing the effects of new medicine.\n\nNot against their will they're not.  You can't get the consent of an animal so the moral implications of experimenting on them is analogous to experimenting on people without their consent.

Organic doesn't mean pesticide free, it means synthetic pesticide free. The word synthetic conjures up lots of negative thoughts, but the truth is pesticides are made to be as safe and effective as possible. The pesticides used in organic agriculture are natural pesticides. There is nothing inherently safe about a pesticide being made by mother nature. Now what i'm about to say is just anecdotal since for the life of me I can't remember where I found it, but natural pesticides are just as carcinogenic as synthetic, sometimes even more. Also natural pesticides aren't as effective per volume which means they have to use a much larger amount.\n\nSo what it comes down to is in some cases organic food could have a larger amount of more dangerous chemicals associated with them. I'm not saying this is always true, but there is nothing inherently more safe about natural than synthetic.	1349315583

He refuses to eat wheat, corn, beef, sugar, tomatoes, and pretty much everything else because he chiropractor is telling him he's allergic. The chiropractor even gave him the subjective allergy test. I asked why he didn't go to an actual trained allergist, and he didn't really have an answer. \n\nHe refuses to eat tomatoes because they belong in the nightshade family and I almost yelled at him for the stupidity of that reasoning. 	1255811939

Given the vast distances between worlds, it's ridiculous to think that radio waves would be used for long-distance communication. Also, it was amusing to see him say "UFO" in reference to an alien spaceship, and "UFO people" to mean "people who think aliens are visiting us." Generally this is a good indicator that the person on your screen has spent little time researching the subject. \n\nZero evidence is presented to prove that we have not (and are not) being visited. He makes vague, fleeting references to crop circles and the ancient aliens theory, and moves on. Zero effort is made to examine ANY of the evidence (that is publicly available) suggesting an ET presence and ET contact. \n\nMore armchair skeptics smugly reassuring each other. Shallow videos like these are to skepticism what blurry cellphone videos are to the UFO community. \n\nEDIT: And sadly, for both sides, videos of such caliber are the norm.	1356320593

That is what she implied.  She implied that only creeps wait until a women is alone in a small confined room to proposition her, and she said she felt sexuality.  What is she creeped out by if she did not fear sexual assault?

It also implies that men who ask women out on a pseudo-date are potential rapists, or at the very least they will potentially sexually assault her.\n\nShe is spreading an irrational fear of men via these inane propaganda tactics.

"There's nothing "less bad" about it." - Maybe I misunderstood this, I took it as a claim that None of the pesticides where a lesser evil than standard ones, but some are proven to be worse?\n\n\n\n\nThe article: \n"Ultimately, the organic products were much less effective than the novel and conventional pesticides at killing the aphids and they have a potentially higher environmental impact" - I think is worth noticing. That said, that was an interesting read, but it says "can", "may" and "potentially" - so there are pointers towards the impact, but the jury is still out on this one.  \nAnd this is only based on soybeans.

One of the worst examples of poor science/medical reporting I've seen was on something similar years (a decade at least) ago. I had recently read of an ongoing clinical study (no results at the time) investigating the use of two infrared lasers at 90° angles designed to use constructive interference at the site of internal tumors to heat the tissue for increased blood flow... etc. Still in the early stages of study is the important part.\n\nThen just a few months after this study made a bit of news I see our local TV health reporter interviewing a chiropractor demonstrating his method of using infrared lasers to treat such things as carpal tunnel syndrome. This "doctor" opened an expensive Seagull brand case which contained a device that looked like a cross between an old fashioned 2 D-cell flashlight and a prop light saber handle. His infrared "laser" projected a visible red circle that he would wave over the patient's wrists followed by a neck "adjustment". Of course his patient claimed to feel better afterwards.\n\nThat was it. That was the extent of the report. No citations of actual clinical results or studies. Nothing.	1312321928

Here let me have a try with you. To think that you can sum up what would have to be Universal realms (because heaven and hell would not only apply to humans), in terms of religious heaven and fiery hell, that's insane. Nobody could gleam anything from being there if they exists for a few moments. 	1355873698
Well said, my man.  I cannot stand people that jump to conclusions so quickly.  It really reveals their blindness of bias.	1345240160
Sometimes I feel amazed how many strange occurrences have happened and we still are no where close to explain them. I wish the human race would advance forward just 100 years... when we have better knowledge of our brains, space-time, the universe and may have some answers for these events.	1326437058

&gt;Supernature does not exist, there is only our natural world and universe.\n\n&gt;There is no nature/supernature duality, creating such is a false dichotomy. \n\nThis is an admirable attitude. So many people don't realize how silly the very concept of "supernatural" is. I wish you the best of luck is spreading this idea.\n\nThat said, I think you have a lot to learn about how to show scientific evidence for something.	1349016776
Based on how advanced any species would need to be to reach us I pretty much immediately discount any crop circles as a human hoax 	1351849548
Thank you for writing this.  Before more recent times, we knew almost nothing about Autism and the lack of diagnosis obviously would account for the "increase".  The sad truth is that before the eighties people with mental disabilities (of any kind) weren't put in school, they were put in community homes, hospitals, mental wards or sometimes just hidden away at home.  We know so much more about mental diseases and disorders so fucking duh there will be an increase in diagnosis as we continue to do research! I know that the issue stems from concern for ones children, but now I have to worry about the safety of my own child because of someone else's decision, not mine.  This more than anything is what scares me.	1334516421
&gt;All they're doing is ruining it for everyone else.\n\nI agree. It's frustrating, because the 95% of sightings that aren't anything extraordinary eclipse the 5% that are really of unknown origin. And since people love to generalize, they ALL end up looking like hoaxes. And I think that is exactly why it's done. Intentional obfuscation.\n\nNobody believed this was real anyway. It was poorly done. A lot of people saw that UFO as it happened, and no crappy hoax will take that experience away.	1238869956

Wouldn't a government agent be in charge of inspecting the product? I imagine it would be like in the food industry: you have to meet minimal quality control requirements to sell food.\n\nThis directive establishes two requirements:\n\n* To prove the product's efficiency: This is done only once, as long as you use the same variety of plant.\n\n* To assure the product's quality: this is true for any type of product. This is done to avoid dying when eating something or killing your children with toxic toys. If someone sells something as medicine, I'd expect minimal assurances with regards to it's quality so I don't die as a consumer.\n	1298041579

Not to say its probable or anything, but I loved the beginning of Battle Los Angeles in how the humans saw a meteor cluster appear that was coming for the earth but appeared to be slowing down, all of which landed in the oceans just outside major cities.\n\nIt certainly presents one possible scenario for alien invasions.	1336932804
I should point out that I'm not the creator of this. I saw in on /r/funny and thought /r/skeptic might find it amusing, or interested that people are peddling such nonsense. Whilst I'm not the Facebook poster, I am inclined to agree with it.\n\nArguments along the line of 'you're an asshole for pointing out they're wrong' are in the same vein as those who shout down people who expose psychics. Sorry, if you spout stuff in a public medium which is demonstrably wrong, expect to be corrected.\n\nMaybe the guy in the Facebook post could have been more subtle, or more concise, but I still think he was in the right.\n\nEdit: Spelling and clarity.	1330886014

So what's with all the Chiropractor hate? I get that this particular one appears to be a bit nutty but there are good ones out there. I finally got completely off pain meds for my back after years of daily pill poping.

When l was about 8 or 9 l had a dream l was on some random farm in some random farmhouse looking out a window. lt was daytime but a storm was rolling in fast. Out of nowhere a tornado comes from left to right into my field of view and everything stops when it reaches the center of the window, then l wake up. Later on the following morning I go to the table for breakfast. l see the morning paper and decide to flip through it. After a few pages, what do l see? The last frame of my tornado dream is the center picture for a story about a tornado that tore up some town in some farm town l can't recall. Strangely l remember feeling a little dumb-founded, but not terribly surprised that it happened. l think that was because my childhood was filled with a whole lot of small occurrences like that.	1342909479
Good point, it does mineralize with bone. However, I don't know that the mechanism for teeth is the same as for long bones.

I see dozens of comments here which repeat the claim that acupuncture has an effect greater than placebo, or equal to Tylenol, etc etc.  I have to step in and point out that these claims are not supported by the evidence.  The studies quoted above and below are primarily studies conducted in China, where the methodology was, frankly, terrible, and the study authors were strongly biased in favor of "proving" an effect.  The well-done studies of acupuncture have never shown an effect other than a very mild placebo - certainly not as good an effect as you get with an over-the-counter pain reliever.	1282746414

I've been doing tarot readings for 12+ years. I've had some people that go absolutely crazy, following every bit of advice I give them to the tee, and seemingly happier for it.

Not everyone who reads cards can read cards for everyone... that'd be my biggest piece of advice!	1327888848

Yes. This is not a junk science location. This is harsh UFO reality here. There's a r/fringe type sub for crystals and what the hell who knows. This is a serious location for those of us that are interested in fact. Not fiction. And we have mods that will nuke weirdoes. Sometimes postings make it through that shouldn't. That's the nature of Reddit. Challenge accepted. But we are not afraid to sift though the internet noise to eventually find something worthy of an x-post to r/askscience. And you can take that to the bank. Well.... Eventually.  	1310785097
Technically 9/11 was the result of US government policy not action but had the government behaved otherwise, Al Qaeda would not have had cause to attach the US. Some things would have been difficult, such as a change of attitude towards Israel but other things such as the ramping down of US troops on Saudi soil would not have been. Funnily enough these were the two main issues that were seen to be triggers.	1290673217
No, its  possible, meaning it's a possibility.  Saying it's probable is to say that it is the cause that holds more weight than any other theory out there.

But there is definitely a problem when people begin to think that they aren't just tricks like with Derren or with these people who claim psychic powers.  I guess I think it's better to make sure people understand that they are just tricks than to preserve that bit of wonder.	1346429689
Global Warming - not that it doesn't exist, but that we can do anything meaningful to reverse it in the time we have. I'm a technological optimist, my stance is that if saving energy is cost efficient and effective then why not. If it hinders societal, technological or economic progress to any great degree then I'm oppose to it. We need to advance science as fast as we can and as soon as we can so we can find permanent solutions to these problems, and especially of the ones nature can put forth (super volcanoes, asteroids, solar flares).	1305181673

Hm? Of chiropractic treatments? Science based medicine that focuses on best practices is the broad stroke replacement.

This was one of the big ones that I never was able to find any info on. I think the fact that there were pictures was a rumor or a hopeful request on behalf of the media. 	1329893182
They also respond to disasters of different sizes. I was caught by the western South Dakota-Nebraska border in the worst storm of my life (and my house has been hit by a small tornado), in which I thought we were going to die. After the unrelenting winds and hail stopped (we were in a van). The water started rising because there were hills around us, it was the beginnings of a flash flood. We decide to get out of there before it gets worse. Interestingly, in nowhere South Dakota, the National Guard even just 20 minutes after the storm was out and had a portable bridge to get over a flooded section of highway and out of danger.\n\nNot to mention that this was near the start of Sturgis (coincidence), so many bikes were trashed.	1344083157

I use neck manipulation if a person is young, in fair to good shape, has a good cardiovascular health history, a clear family history for stroke/aneurysm/atherosclerosis, no signs of acute distress in the maximal foraminal compression test position, absense of the 5 Ds and other warning signs.  But that is only if they have a motion fixation and only if they are presenting for neck pain or headache.\n\nHonestly I go back and forth on whether the profession is salvagable.  There is just so much baggage in the name and so many problems within the profession.  \n\nSomedays it seems like it would be easier/better to let the DPTs/Physiotherapists take over our roles. And then you have a day where a patient who comes to you after being treated only 3-4 times and cries because they had been to everyone from pain management to PT and they felt like you were the last hope before surgery and they are 80-90% improved.  \n\nThose days make you feel good and happy with your profession.\n\nMore likely than not the profession will bloom or die within the next 30 years.  If it continues to stay alternative and outside the standard healthcare realm it will die (to much is being pulled into the big practice/hospital based groups for chiros to continue to function independently).  There are groups like the West-Hartford Group trying to move the profession forward and there are schools starting residencies in Orthopedics, Neurology, Family practice with medical programs so there is hope for the profession to evolve.	1342744233
Now compare U.S. Hospital birth outcomes to other first world countries, the results are even more depressing. The. U.S. Is more in the range of a third world country, all while being far and away the most expensive place on earth to have a hospital birth.

Admitted to be a fake by the poster of the vid:\n\n"This "UFO" was launched Feb. 14 2011 from my back yard. It consisted of garbage bags full of helium with flares suspended below (with steel wire for obvious reasons, and a few other details have been left out). This launch consisted of five flares with model rocket fuse to delay ignition so they only illuminate once they were several thousand feet up. I know a lot of people are upset about this being a "hoax" or whatever you want to call it. Bottom line is, it is what it is, and it looked awesome!! I am not trying to debunk real UFO's, I tend to lean more towards them existing than not, either extraterrestrial or not. I know there are a lot of people who spend some serious time and devotion researching and looking into sightings.\nThis is one of the reasons I came forward, (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgYTaptE­gZw) I didn't want people wasting there serious time and effort on a "snipe hunt". Fun as it would have been to sit back and watch, I decided to "let the cat out of the bag" out of simple respect. I'd like to think that is something still worth having these days.\nSome people have had good fun with it (http://cryptoworld.co.uk), some still have no idea, and others have acted flat out childish in their response, (as can be seen in the comments of the video, and the phone calls and emails I have been receiving)\nFor those who still refuse to believe it was me, please refer to video response ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufbSi-... which not only shows the ignition of a third flare, along with smoke, but it is of the "UFO" that started this whole situation in the first place, on 1-26-2011.

What? WHAT? I had sleep paralysis, I had an "out of body experience" when I smoked some strong weed after taking antibiotics, that was a totally explainable phenomena - my brain remembered the surroundings and played them back from the 3rd person, just like in the game. I had sleep paralysis during class - I couldn't move, but I heard and felt everything, but in more deep cases SP causes hallucinations. As much as I believe in UFOs and some of their weird properties you have no right to say that sleep paralysis means that the person was abducted. I don't believe in "bed abductions". \n\nJust a little secret: I spent an hour writing you a private message, because I saw past myself in you. I wanted to believe that I'm not just a machine made by self evolving, that there would be some kind of afterlife, some channel in the fabrique of space-time, but now it is gone. There is nothing else. Just your brain (It is you) that when you die ends your being. Deal with it. I'm really sorry, but I'm going through an emotional trauma and I can't pass any opinions that stand out of the more rational side of UFO evalutation.\n\nIf you want to talk more on the subject, hit me up. And again, sorry.	1340252481

I'm not sure there's any conclusive evidence to say the just rBGH is a reason to cut out dairy. I think there are others, though.

Comp line. Lack of perspective change. Weird movement and a bad "fade" into the clouds. We see several layers of cloud throughout the video, yet not once in it's ascent does it become obscured by a defined cloud edge. There's also the fact that the clouds are in sharper focus than the object. Which is odd considering its closer to the viewer than the clouds. 	1341421178
I noticed that some people are religious out of necessity and some are religious out of ignorance. Any time I see someone who is religious because their reality is so bleak that they need an invisible man in the sky to speak to or a light at the end of the tunnel I let them be. Because this professor is obviously very intelligent, he's probably not religious because of ignorance and perhaps he uses religion as a coping mechanism for something. Then again, he could be ignorant when it comes to religion and very intelligent when it comes to physics.\n\nMaybe you should question him on why he's still religious?	1347240066
I find it a bit hypocritical that you would accept the OP's statement of losing respect for someone who puts faith in one type of nonsense without evidence, then chastise him/her for saying he/she loses respect for someone who puts faith in *another* type of nonsense without evidence.

I was specifically talking about veganism which bans all animal products, not vegetarianism which generally allows for eggs and cheese.  I suspect it may be possible to keep a balanced diet when going vegetarian, but it didn't work out for me, so that part is anecdotal.  For me it just wasn't worth the effort to try an keep a balanced diet on a vegetarian basis as some meat does a good fast job of curing what ales me.	1346294358
Cannabis is relaxing, and makes people 'feel better'. Maybe cannabis users are getting better because they are less stressed and suffering from lower pain levels. It also improves appetite, so it's also possible that users are eating more and obtaining more necessary nutrients for their body to repair itself. \n\nTL;DR : Maybe it's not the chemicals that work the 'magic', it's the 'feels good man' part that improves people's overall health?	1342121749
I get comments on my blog all the time by people who obviously have not read what I wrote.

I agree Lon. Nearly total gobbledigook. It always amazes me that all the supposed civilizations that are interacting with us are ONLY 1000's or 100's of years ahead of us in Technology/Worldliness - when it is very easily possible that some species, if they exist, could be millions if not billions of years advanced. Indeed, the folks that seem to make up this stuff need a better imagination when it comes to time.	1262210198
That is very true	1327444516
In the context of parallel realities, precognitive dreams can be situations where  you tap into a probable future. There is never any "guaranteed future" just probabilities. Stuff like this is really for the purpose of having an expanded view of life. But science discounts it because people cannot predict the future on demand. Anyway, enjoy the synchronicity and be open for more. :)	1328641190
Totally agree with this.	1319164146

Well...it was years ago, and all I can remember is that it was hosted by a bookstore. I'll look around and get back to you.\n\nAlso, the guy who gave the tour was actually from an aristocratic family that had been in Savannah for generations. He had an amazing voice, and gave tours occasionally for fun and for love of his city. I sadly cannot promise that you will be able to recreate such an experience. I was really lucky.\n\nEdit: But then again, Savannah is an amazing place exactly because of the quirky and fascinating people who inhabit it. If you explore a bit, you are bound to find cool people and fun to be had.	1353278778
The mainstream media generally tends to go with whatever makes for a better story because that is what brings in the most viewers and readers and makes them the most money. There is no deliberate push for skepticism, unless skepticism is what sells. Mainstream news sources are businesses after all.\n\nAlso, I don't think that an article from a weird, funny and bizarre section can be considered a push.	1352332419

&gt; I was into ufos for years (from childhood to college) but after taking a realistic and critical look at my views I changed my mind.\n\nWow.  Seriously?  So you took a "realistic and critical look" at what you were doing and said what?  "You know what?  This ufo and ET business is all bullshit.  I was into it because I was a kid and it was fun kid stuff to do.  But now I'm all grown up and now I know that stuff was just all hocus pocus b.s. baloney.  All about as real as Santa Clause."\n\nThat?\n\n&gt; I'm not feeling the continual meta-analysis of our discussion.\n\nFair enough.  You don't have to respond to the above question then.\n\n&gt; I understand my methods are imperfect.\n\nFair enough.  Mine aren't either, to be sure.  No one's are.	1343630371

A lot of the main topics have already been suggested, so to expand things a bit further, I'll propose that skeptics should also get to understand:\n\n1) **the concept of [scientism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism)**. It's often used as a meaningless insult by people pushing stupid ideas, but it is actually an important and valid concept that we should be aware of. Essentially, it describes a position which views science as the only method for collecting knowledge, and/or an attempt to apply the scientific method to areas outside of its domain. Often I find this mistake is committed by people with a cursory knowledge of the scientific method and often no philosophical education.\n\n2) **the anti-psychology movement.** Although currently not as troublesome as the anti-vax or creationist movements, I find this fairly recent trend quite troubling. The popularised version of it comes through outdated writers like Thomas Szasz, and the scientology attacks, but I don't find these areas too problematic (because Szasz's concerns have all been addressed, and everyone recognises the scientologists to be nuts). However, it disturbs me that often when talking with people, even in places like /r/skeptic, there will be common mentions of how "adhd is overdiagnosed" or "big pharma is trying to medicalise normal behaviors" or the more general comments of "psychology isn't a science" (which tends to allow people to reject psychological results). 	1336962991
The feeling is similar to, assuming you've experienced it, having a word on the tip of your tongue. Like you have the shape of the word you want to say, the general idea and "feeling" of it, the fact that it starts with a "puh" sound, but no matter how hard you try to recall it, the word just slips away further out of reach.\n\nDeja vu is like that, except instead of a word it'll be a place, sight, situation, or particular experience. You have a feeling that you know you've experienced this particular moment before but no matter how hard you try to remember where or how you've been in this situation before, it just slips away. \n\nOtherwise it's also similar to trying to remember a dream, but I didn't want to use that as an example because it sounds even more abstract and confusing than the forgotten word analogy. But seriously, the feeling of deja vu is so similar to trying to remember a dream that it's difficult to tell them apart, and many people will swear up and down that they experienced a particular situation in a dream they had.	1315816790
It sounds like a huge undertaking, and like getting authors on board is definitely the way to do it.\n\nIs there something you could suggest authors add to their website that could be crawled or searched? Well, that would probably lead to spam or something...maybe an API for submitting them where we can write plugins for blogging tools that will submit them when a rebuttal is posted?	1341025978
Haha! I love how they think that atheists only believe in things that are physical.  What the fuck kind of "logic" is that?  Numbers are not a physical thing, and yet atheists believe in them exactly because they are logical and testable.  Even a strict materialist would still believe in abstract concepts.  Language, Government, Social science.  The difference is that all of these concepts are testable in one fashion or another.  Whenever I am trying to explain logical fallacy to someone, I will just send them to Answers In Genesis from now on.  The site is chock full of them.	1275938352

From what I've seen, the only reason why any of the fad diets ever work, is because people cut back without realizing it.  When someone decides they aren't going to eat any carbs, they start not eating all the snack foods they normally would have, and are less likely to eat fast food, since most of it comes on a bun.\n\nReally, its all about take in fewer calories, burn more, not much else really matters.	1353357072

&gt;The notion is that "critical" or "scientific" thinking is a cultural construction specific to the West, and the knowledge it produces is not inherently more "right" than other ways of thinking\n\nScience is merely the method we use for finding what actually works (to oversimplify). And what actually works is, in my mind, more "right" that what does not work.	1304690331

&gt;One thought suggests that when amber is worn on the skin, the skin’s warmth releases miniscule amounts of healing oils from amber which are then absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream.\n\nThis could easily be tested, but like so many other bits of centuries old wonder knowledge we can just trust the Egyptians or whoever...\n\n&gt;The other theory is based on scientific findings which have shown that amber is electromagnetically alive and produces significant amounts of organic, purely natural energy.\n\nThis can't be tested due to the extreme level of crazy.  To soften the crazy they added the words "theory" and "scientific", but no actual theories or experimental results...	1257864609
Because any positive attention to the subject by any administration is good.

I respectfully disagree that the MRM is "built" around such strawman tactics. Sure, I have seen such tactics deployed there, but I've also seen a lot of sound sociological data to back up claims.  A good example that comes up frequently is data on the incidence of domestic violence, used to counter the myth that men are always the aggressors and women always the victims.\n\nThey may not be a model skeptical organization, but neither are they total demagogues.\n\nTo come at this from a different angle, you've no doubt heard from feminist organizations that women make 77 cents for every dollar that men make.  This statistic implies that a woman earns less for the doing same work performed by a man, when the actual causes of the discrepancy boil down almost completely to career choice and family leave.  Does espousing this misleading figure discredit feminism? Most people, myself included, would say no, in no small part because despite the exaggeration, there is a real problem they're trying to draw attention to.	1345308444

Reading through most of the thread it seems to me that you came here with preconceived notion and was frustrated when you didn't get the answer you wanted. Discussion seems to go along the lines of 'we are not dismissive of the effect', 'only is not used in derogatory meaning, just to describe the lack of actual physical effects along the mental effects' and you seem to answer with variations of 'no no no, people are dissing, not you specifically but people'.\nHopefully the plethora of explanations about the differences of dismissing the placebo effect and realizing its actual useful points; not misusing it for nefarious ends or from misunderstanding the effects; understanding that 'only' means there are no other help you understand our viewpoint.	1328535610
I picked up this used copy of a book titled "Encyclopedia of Signs, Omens, and Superstitions" by *Zolar*. I have no idea how credible this Zolar guy is (back of the book calls him the dean of American astrology, and he has no Wikipedia entry), however if half of the superstitions in this book are even somewhat true, we are doing amazingly well.\n\nHere are a few I just picked at random:\n\n* a European tradition holds that a child suffering from respiratory illness should be carried through a gasworks plant or a place where gas is actually manufactured. A cure will be forthcoming.\n\n* An alternative treatment for Gallstones is to boil sheep's dung in new milk until dissolved and drink it each day. This is said to be a sure cure.\n\n* Tradition holds that cholera can be detected by throwing a piece of raw meat up in the air. If it turns black then the disease is present.\n\n* Should a baby's naval refuse to heal, a plowshare buried while five Lord's Prayers are recited over it will bring about a healing. 	1326485667

&gt;As a concept, I think libertarian economics is a fantastic idea but I doubt it would ever work on a large scale, similar to a true communist society could not work on a large scale. I have no problem with paying taxes as long as those taxes go toward services and not used improperly (bailing out banks come to mind).\n\nThe problem is that there is the arrogance and greedy self righteous thought Penn was talking about. It's fine to say *you* would pay taxes, but the whole issue is about using violent force to make *others* pay taxes against their will. Are you really smart enough to know with absolute certainty what everyone wants? Or do you admit you are a selfish person who has no problem making people do things against their wills to satisfy your own wants? 	1313545426

I'm going to take "extra-dimensional being" and pretend you said extraterrestrial being, because what a being from another dimension would be, to me, seems to be outside of what we qualify as life and also I don't know why they would fly in aircraft unless they were 3rd dimensional like us.\n\nRegarding videos like this, at best they're evidence of UFO phenomenon or unconventional aircraft, and that is at absolute best.  There isn't any evidence anywhere of any sort that UFO phenomenon is in anyway connected to extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nEven the truest of believers can't point to any, they just think it *can't be anything else*, and it's typically a very early question I ask when discussing UFOs with them - having been, I guess you could say, a UFO hunter myself for a long time.	1302629259

I had no idea heat stroke was good for back problems. I've enjoyed both at one time or another, but I never thought of combining the maladies.\n\nActually, what they are calling hyperthermia is something quite different from the medical term.

I would judge it as a good placebo at best. They do have a pretty patient in the video, though.\n	1286681248
Wait really?\n\nThere are plenty of ways eating meat is contentious at every scale. I'm not saying we shouldn't eat meat, but a pragmatist could wonder on the scene and be like "Woooah!

Haven't you guys ever heard of the *hard* problem -- you literally can't know what those animals are experiencing!

As a beekeeper, I can attest to the fact that honey straight from the apiary does indeed taste much better than the crap you get at a store. (note: anecdotal) But all the shit about the supposed health benefits it has is crap. I'm bombarded by it all the time in the beekeeping community. It's impossible to escape the BS. There's always someone who thinks literally every thing that bees make (honey, pollen, propolis, wax, bee venom, *yes* I said **motherfucking bee venom**) has health benefits. You'd think bees have some kind of magical properties by listening to my fellow beekeepers.\n\nThe sad thing is, you don't really need to invent pseudoscientific bullshit for this. Fresh honey really does taste so much better than storebought honey. and there are economic and environmental reasons to support local beekeepers. No need for snake oil bullshit. It's kind of the same with organic foods too, I've noticed. I don't buy into the hype, but I have noticed that organic things do taste better. That could just be me, though. 	1343298002
What do you mean if we put a band aid on the problem? Vaccinactions are one of the miracles of modern medical science. Polio is almost eradicated,small pox only exists in labs. \n\nIn refernce to the pertusis vax lets look at known side effects. According to the [cdc](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#dtap)  I see no death here. The moderate side effects(1 in 14,000) lists seizures.  Now lets compare to the harm of getting pertussis according to the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/complications.html)  \n\n* 1 in 5 get pneumonia (lung infection)\n* 1 in 100 will have convulsions (violent, uncontrolled shaking)\n* Half will have apnea (slowed or stopped breathing)\n* 1 in 300 will have encephalopathy (disease of the brain)\n* 1 in 100 will die\n\nSo a 1 in 14000 chance of seizure or a 1 in 100 chance (if one gets the disease) of death. It sounds like a no brainer to me.	1319254504

Unless parents submit a letter saying they are against vaccines on religious grounds.  \n\nhttp://www.nvic.org/Vaccine-Laws/state-vaccine-requirements.aspx\n\nWest Virginia and Mississippi are the only two states who only allow medical exemptions, every other state allows at least religious and often philosophical exemptions.  Non-vaccinating parents will lie on exemption forms, claiming religious beliefs for not vaccinating.  Most of the time they're not challenged and if they are they coach each other on what to say to sound sincere.\n\nNY does have the ability to challenge whether someone's belief is sincerely held, some other states it was ruled that is an invasion of privacy.  However, you can see [here](http://www.counsel.nysed.gov/Decisions/volume48/d15845.htm)  how little is needed before a judge to achieve this.	1329660960

The only way that official disclosure will happen is if the actual aliens allow it to occur, I believe that if they have contact with our leaders, they are the actual bosses and nothing will happen until they want it to.\n\nIf you study abduction stories, you'll learn that these beings are probably human in appearance, which to me explains ancient stories of angels coming down and communicating with humans, "greys" are probably another species created by these beings to do their "dirty work".\n\nRead, **don't watch** "fire in the sky", Travis Walton had direct contact with these "human" aliens.	1340712540

In my city we have a lot of orange trees. They used to have people pick the oranges in set them in crates beside the tree for anyone to take(they no longer do this though). In general there is plenty of fruit availible to the homeless and they know where it is(according to the Fallen Fruit group which picks public fruit, and originally thought the homeless would be interested but found out they weren't)\n\nHomeless people need hot meals, coffee, socks, soap.	1351384368
I can look at the Drake Equation (we have only begun to fill in the unknown terms) and say there is almost certainly life elsewhere in the universe.  But it is a huge leap between saying life probably exists to suggesting intelligent aliens are popping by for incognito visits.\n\nI am not saying it's completely impossible, (although we still can't even say that FTL travel is even theoretically possible) but if I see something strange in the sky, I would only suggest ET when all of the more probable explanations (Terrestrial aircraft, weather, astronomical phenomenon, hoaxes) have been completely ruled out.\n	1346512608

The core reason of my asking deals with the energy moving through your body. When we're stressed, fatigued, etc; the quantity and quality of the energy moving through our bodies is lessened and it has an effect on how we perceive the universe and our surroundings.\n\nConsider a dream... when you have good energy flowing into your energy double/astral body in the dream state, dreams are more vivid and you tend to become lucid and self-aware of the dream rather quickly. When energy fades; the dream starts to collapse and crumble.\n\nI think the same applies to our waking state (the collective dream we're all sharing IMO). It may have been a slight glitch in your energy level that impaired your ability to interpret the energy coming from that person.\n\nI see two scenarios from this...\n\n* Either this person themselves had a glitch/oddity in their energy/consciousness and this event would then be perceivable to other people who would have been present.\n\n* The glitch is more subjective; had another person been in the car with you, they wouldn't have seen anything odd occur. This would mean your energy level dropped to a low level or there was some energetic distortion in your decoding process as your eyes collected the information.\n\nIf it happens again, try to document the event with as much detail as possible; what happened prior, what you were expecting in the future and how your body felt; sensations before, during and after.	1346626185

As I have foamed at the mouth about here a few times before -- actually, there is an enormous obstacle to science concluding anything like this. No matter what we discover or observe in our universe, science has two options: naturalistic explanation, or to not render an explanation. In the face of a seemingly supernatural phenomenon, science is simply forbidden to conclude supernaturalism. Instead, any good scientist will say, "This is a weird phenomenon, we don't understand it, but we'll keep studying it until we do." Even if we heard some booming voice say, "Hello, I am God," science is duty-bound to say, "How do we verify this? How do we investigate the nature of this voice? Could it arise from something naturalistic?" Supernaturalism is not a conclusion that science can make, only "we don't know yet".	1248263552

Interesting ethical dilemma.\n\nYour friend says she's feeling better. Even if it is just the placebo effect... do you want to take that away from her?\n\nAlso, alternative medicine isn't *all* bunk and hokum - some of it can be effective. Sometimes natural treatments which work end up being branded "alternative" because they're not able to be patented and sold by big pharma.\n\nThat said, it's definitely worthwhile finding out what this doctor has prescribed for your friend. At least make sure it's not actively harmful: even if it's not helping beyond the placebo effect, you don't want it to make your friend worse.	1310389292

I have to agree with it probably being an intense case of sleep paralysis...The other night I was staying at my friends small cabin and I woke up to the sound of someone opening the screen door and walking in, then walking into the bathroom and closing the door. I Just thought it was my friend at first, but then I heard him snoring. I heard movement in the bathroom and i was scared shitless and had no idea who or what it could be. I wanted to look but I honestly could not move for the life of me. Once I heard it walk back out I turned to my friend and was trying to scream at him and I couldn't. I am 19 and haven't felt this scared since I was little. I somehow close my eyes and open them and then get out of bed and wake my friend up and we look outside and see an alien at the door walking back towards us. I then wake up again, realizing the room had been different than it was during the first hallucination. This is how I rationalized that I was just having sleep paralysis. The fact that it was the normal room the first time, then it changed. If I hadn't made that realization I may have had a heart attack.	1326478964

It would rip open old wounds and be incredibly disrespectful to the family.\n\nWhenever called on his bullshit he reverts to the defense that it is no more ridiculous than believing in Jesus.

Valid points,  yet Kevin Ryan is also critiquing elements of the investigational methods themselves in a valid way,  and it was this aspect of his presentation that interested me not the engineering components.    Even if you disregard the engineering elements of the video,  there is enough factual information there about how the previous investigations were conducted for his presentation to be valuable in getting this point across.   The real science has yet to be presented by both sides or challenged by both sides in the context you suggest,  and my point is that I am encouraging this to happen,   and that it cannot happen without there first being a proper investigation where the necessary data is made available to both sides.  [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW6mJOqRDI4) is another video where real engineers are asking for that professionally sanctioned format of presentation based on a new and more valid investigation.\n\nedit:  I am not endorsing all elements of either video.   For lack of better material to try to make my point,  I am giving you examples of critiques of the previous investigations and proof that the engineering community is far from having had the opportunity to properly present and challenge their sides.   The present video shows that there are credible members (not all presented,  but some) of the engineering community who agree with this, not just a chemist.	1316263719

You missed my point. You can achieve the same goal (keeping anti-vax people away from susceptible family members) without alienating a friend. You're propagating a false dichotomy where either you be an asshole and protect your child or you be nice and endanger your child. To the contrary, you can explain it civilly as a friend and still protect your child from the non-vaccinated family.\n\nBeing an asshole about it not only pushes them away as a friend, but it also is a poor representation of us skeptics. It will just confirm in their minds that they made the right choice if everyone they disagree with is an asshole about it.\n\nI'll put it this way: we all probably know people who are dangerous, distracted drivers. Being a bad driver is endangering other people (and their children). Does that mean you deride and stop being friends with anyone you know who checks their phone while driving? No, instead, you can just explain to them that you choose to not let your child ride with that person because of the dangerous choices they make. \n\n**TL;DR - Keep your friend by being civil and still protect your child from people making dangerous decisions**	1344467325

I understand what you are saying.  The difference between being skeptical and being willing to consider anything that one comes into contact with lies in what skepticism is and how certain things can be weeded out ahead of time, usually by way of Bayesian statistics.  There are different schools of thought in this area but, for myself, I do not tend to spend much time considering that which depends on faulty logic, conspiracy, false appeals to science or to be considered scientific, and outright improbability.  \n\nSo, while it may seem as though I am being close-minded, it is quite the opposite.  I have spent time considering what many truthers and 9/11 conspiracies claim and have concluded that it is highly improbable that little, if anything claimed bears any truth from a psychological, physical, logical, political, or tactical standpoint.  That is why I say it is not worth the time and energy to debate.  However, you may find others in this subreddit who disagree with me.  \n\nEdit: wording	1333994074

Round/saucer shaped UFOs make sense if you believe they fly in our atmosphere due to the coanda effect--Actually, the saucer shape is the ideal shape for it, there are even mowers that uses a weak form of this effect to hover\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coand%C4%83_effect\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=coanda+mower&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=14&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=hover+lawn+mower&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oIJYUJzbMvGN0QGLmYCACg&amp;ved=0CDgQsxg&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=4a2e3ab76ff57b8a&amp;biw=1163&amp;bih=624\n\nJust remember, what it takes to fly is more or equal force downwards as the (object mass*acceleration of gravity), which is what a wing does, a wing creates downward vortexes that travel down the edge of the wing and off the tip pushing air "downwards" in a continuous stream to keep the plane in the air.  The coanda effect could do the same thing while hovering in one spot much like a helicopter does only way more effectively.	1347979376

It is, however, more than a tad ironic that James Randi himself seems to have become a victim (or an accomplice) to a deception in his personal life. Randi's long-time companion, Jose Luis Alvarez, was arrested in early Sept. 2011 for identity thief (Franceschina and Burstein, 2011). This news story carries the additional irony that a master of fraud detection has himself been deceived (my personal condolences and my recognition that any person can be deceived). However, in this case, the man posing as Jose Luis Alvarez had, with Randi's help and advocacy, once pretended to be a "medium" in Australia as a media stunt and test of the "new age" community there. Randi and "Alvarez" got significant media coverage for this hoax.\n\nThe old adage that people teach what they themselves need to learn seems to have special meaning here.\n\nTracey Brown: Science Educator or Big Pharma PR Agent?\n\nMost people probably have not heard of Tracey Brown, the director of Sense About Science (also known as SAS), a British organization that has campaigned against homeopathic medicine and in favor of GMOs in foods.\n\nPrior to Ms. Brown's involvement at Sense About Science, she was a senior analyst in the "Risk Analysis Unit" of the leading British public relations company, Regester Larkin, a company known to represent Big Pharma, Big Oil and Big Multinationals. However, Ms. Brown does not list her former employment at Regester Larkin at the SAS website. To her credit, however, she does not hide the fact that more than one-third of the money that SAS raised between 2004 and 2009 was derived from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMs. Brown's bio at the SAS website also does not mention her former connection to "Living Marxism," which began in 1988 as the journal of the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), and later became the glossy LM Magazine. The demise of LM was linked to its denial of one of the atrocities for which Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic is currently awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court. In the mid-1990s the respected British TV news organization ITN scored a major scoop when it filmed a secret concentration camp operated by Mladic's forces. LM claimed that this footage was fabricated. Concerned about its reputation with the numerous news organizations to which it had sold the footage, ITN took LM to court, and won. The fine and costs imposed on LM led to its bankruptcy. A year or so later, this far left group reemerged as a libertarian organization with a strong anti-regulation and anti-environmental bent, and an aggressively pro-GM (genetic modification) stance (Goldsmith, 2010).\n\n	1317747366

Yup. Exactly. It's a massive fleet. If there were 9 lanterns, it wouldn't be a massive fleet of lanterns. But, since there are so many lanterns, it's a massive fleet of lanterns. The OP video is far from a massive fleet of light-emitting-objects(regardless of what they are).	1314757024
I think it does. Anecdotal, but I've been mugged twice, and whilst it pissed me off, and knocked my confidence for a couple of months, it didn't leave long term damage. Sexual aspects *do* make stuff a whole lot worse.	1340534525
Ha, I haven't watched it in a few years. The marketers probably thought they would sell more DVDs if they added 'science'. Which was probably true. 	1334950354

Glad you asked. I'm wondering what the paranormal link here is...	1330344032
Well if it has any effect it is still an effect...I guess I should stay on topic	1313439591
Wow... that's.... holy shit.	1321399641
I'm not sure how to explain it, tbh. English is not my first language, so I struggle a bit with abstract concepts, but I'll give it a shot. As I've said, I consider it more of an unexplained dynamic than anything to do with energies. But then again, since everything is energy, in a way it does. I don't doubt that what I'm rambling on about can be explained by science, it's just that I myself haven't come across the scientific material to explain it all. If you're better informed, I'd be glad to hear your input.\n\n  The reason I use the words "spirit" and the like are mostly because I don't know what other words to use to describe the concept. To summarize it briefly, it's about the effect that focus, intention and... *willpower* I guess would be a better word, has on physical movement. This is entirely based on my own experience, but in 9 years of practicing traditional martial arts, I've come to believe that there is a good deal more to movement than pure form. Beyond the kinetic chain in the muscles. I've seen and experienced numerous techniques where intention and focus would *seem* to have a palpable effect. *Mind over matter* as it were, to use an old cliché.\n\n  I'm convinced that it's essentially biomechanical; I just don't understand how it works as of yet.	1269624323
Well, we could start with the part where he quote mined http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060823093156.htm and specifically left out the part where they noted that the behavior he was demonizing is beneficial.\n\nAdditionally, I checked through his NIH links, mostly located in the hilariously FUD-worthy section labeled 'toxic anti-nutrients' - and doesn't really provide much more of the overall context of the articles, just grabs some of the worst case info from them and adds it. The most interesting one there is the http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16129731 study, which I'll admit offers some interesting information, but I'd like to see more verification.\n\nHis gluten paragraph is amazing, considering how much he goes into the effects of an allergen on those allergic to it. I wonder about the effects of beef allergy, and if he'd devote a huge article to it's damaging effects as well. The only part of gluten he even talked about was that anti-gliadin IgA shows up in the stool of non-celiac sufferers, but fails to then go on to show any actual damaging effects of gluten to back it up.\n\nAs you mentioned in another comment here, I don't disagree that any diet that consists of 'eat less, move more' as a basic philosophy is going to lead to weight loss, but the problem is in the villification of various entities that forms the basis of paleo dieting.	1345841608
Sure thing. Just after she disprove Penn and Teller do real magic.	1320206245
I'll give him this much: he didn't claim to cure diseases with it, and his disclaimer at the bottom was very clear on that. \nOtherwise, sounds like the "Power of Positive Thinking" upgraded for the 21st century. Crap, but relatively benign crap :-). 	1350468930
I used the default mosaic filter in photoshop.  I additionally created a second layer with a fill of 0% and a black stroke to highlight the post of interest.

Doubt it.  Most elevator shafts have gaps on the sides.  Air pressure would've only built up as she neared the bottom, but I doubt (based on things like mythbusters) that it would've been enough to slow the elevator's descent by much.\n\nIt was probably one helluva ride.	1332537967

&gt; Tell me, if you would, who this enemy is that the US is oh so obligingly protecting him from?\n\nThe many fellow Muslims who have suffered at the hands of his organisation. Why would the US want to avoid these people taking some posthumous revenge? Because it would unnecessarily incite retaliation against these people.\n\n&gt; You're really full of shit. One moment he's a terrible guy, next moment you're praising faux respect for him.\n\nNo, I'm responding to *your* claim that the US was being spiteful in it's treatment of his body. I simply pointed out that your accusations of spite were unfounded.\n&gt; And let me just nip this one in the bud too: he had more balls than any redditor, and influenced people on a scale that gives redditors wet dreams.\n\nHe's been hiding for years. He could have become a martyr, as he had encouraged so many others to do, by dying in battle or even by simply continuing as the public face of his organisation. Instead he hid away while others took over the duty he claimed was so holy and just.	1304390314
So, at first I thought this was sorted based on healthy vs unhealthy foods, but then I see prunes and nuts on the "acidic" side, so now I'm really confused. 	1339658496
&gt; Myth: Margarine is 1 molecule away from plastic\n\nWhat the hell is this even supposed to mean?

I'm not trying to insult you but is a physicist as qualified as an engineer when it comes to this argument? \n\nI'm only referring to building 7 when it comes to the collapse.

You people?\n\nWhat does the middle east have to do with this article?	1331506585

Coloradan here\n\nThe road from springs to salida is fucking scary. People up there drive like maniacs as well, the highway follows the arkansas river through a steep canyon for a majority of the trip between canyon city and salida, its right next to the [royal gorge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Gorge). I know forsure i keep my eyes on the road at all times if i go through there, because it's easy to get distracted by the beauty and it's definetley easy to run off the road into the river.	1317761022

He has finally had to slightly change his tune in recent years.  He now says he is a 'mystifier' and does not claim nor deny that he has "powers".\n\n(From http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/27/27217/1.html)\n\n"I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, to the best of my recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. I doesn´t mean that I don´t have powers. It means that I don´t say "it’s supernatural", I say "I´m a mystifier!" That´s what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, "Uri Geller said he’s a magician!" I never said that. And I will never say that. Even Criss Angel asked me in an interview on his show. "Are you a magician?" I said "No, what do you want? I’m a mystifier." "But can you bend a spoon if I put a spoon on the table?" "Yes, I can bend a spoon with a trick, but that doesn´t mean that I don´t have powers. People want to hear and write what they want to hear, not what I say. "	1343227851
Yep. I was a hardcore skeptic on both fronts up until a few years ago. Then, I saw my first (and only) 'ghost'. I'm still waiting to see god...	1356558752

Hmm I'll have to look into this, my recollection was that contemplating death tends to reinforce existing beliefs; theists tend to increase their belief in god, whereas atheists tend to increase their disbelief. I'll see if I can do some digging.	1350965948
They sell these at my school. They wouldn't be too bad if they cost 80% less, but there's no use in paying $25 (or however much they cost) for a cool-looking bracelet that was cranked out of a sweatshop for 80 cents.	1298506055

&gt;The page goes on about Stevia being banned, but Rebaudioside A, an extract of Stevia (of which the Truvia being railed against is an example) is available as a food sweetener. The unprocessed leaves are available as a dietary supplement, but with the dearth of regulation in the supplement industry, that isn't saying much. It seems reasonable to me that the refined active ingredient would be approved more quickly than the unrefined natural product, with its impurities and non-standardized ingredients. My feeling is that that's a more likely explanation than conspiracy.\n\nYes, what appears at first glance to be a conspiracy is really just the natural result of a system built around patentable additives. The FDA really is geared towards approving synthesized singular additives, and the food industry isn't interested in making an extract of stevia, because there's no money in developing an additive that can't be patented.	1277047958

Haha good point. Sometimes they have gems of feel-good stories, and my other subscriptions are generally a bit heavier so it's good to have something a bit fluffy to read occasionally. I'm not really into lolcats, so it seemed like a reasonable compromise. 	1341887162
yup, I was napping and felt myself sit up, when I looked down I was still sleeping and I panicked. I layed back down where I saw myself and continued dreaming. could have been only dreaming, but it was vivid as day. so freaky!	1353883477
Sounds like you just came across one stupid person, or possibly it was a war of pedantics and you guys just misunderstood each other.\n\nWay to denounce an entire subreddit because of it.	1317138696
I agree with the bit about attitude, however, these aren't dead horses. New subscribers are always riding these horses in and it applies moreso to the real world, where this kind of shit is always happening. The general knowledge of society at large is not on par with you. There are plenty of people being born every day, including yesterday, and they will need to be caught up. 	1335453442
Maybe so, depending on the problem, but they are still figuring out which specialist and seeing to it that more than the symptom is addressed. 	1335362578

I know this was discussed in detail on one of the science podcasts I listen to (SGU?  Radiolab?)  I vaguely recall that the overall story is true, but that there was some crucial detail that was being left out of almost every news story that covered it.  Something about the second boyfriend maybe?  I also remember a similar new story about a transgender woman that had an immaculate conception so maybe I'm mixing that in?\n\nDoes anyone else know what popular skeptic/science source covered this?	1350836175
Excellent points.	1313565338

just at work, so I can't really look into your links (I will after, though.)\n\nBut, c'mon, you know that's a logical fallacy - by pulling the "that's just a youtube video" when there's a lot of great, factual stuff on youtube. (specifically, it's not just some youtube video, it's a collection of professionals in the industry who cite straightforward scientific principles to back their claim. As for the free-fall thing, more info can be found at http://ae911truth.org/en/evidence.html under the powerpoint presentation - I don't know if the link is still there, it's been awhile - but when I have more time I will look for it.)	1350320171
The problem is that even many scientists struggle to read the scientific papers of another scientist. That slows scientific progress if new discoveries and ideas are made harder to parse than need be.	1334271958
Yea that's exactly what I am....a fucking nutcase.	1349215363
what would you expect drawing conclusions like that on the Internet? Its like saying theres a large film industry in America so the moon landing was fake. Unsubstantiated claims irritate me. With the evidence presented I doubt anyone of us could make an educated hypothesis. I come to this subreddit to explore the UFO phenomenon and read some intelligent feedback and grow tired of skeptics like you without anything to add besides 'it's CGI". So sorry if I'm not 'civil' enough for you, i apologize if i hurt your feelings. And one more thing, don't assume I'm young, makes you look like a dick.	1331962687

&gt; Interesting question: what do you all think it would take for this group to finally admit to no link?\n\nMagic, or a major marginalization of the anti-vaxxer movement. Pseudo-scientific beliefs are unsinkable rubber ducks, which can often be disproved, but then they'll just pop up with a new tactic and it will probably end up being some new disease or condition once the autism "connection" has been absolutely debunked.	1265313676

But then again, people want to believe so much that they neglect the obvious. I'd love to see "aliens" proven as fact for my own personal reasons, but it doesn't mean I'm going to freak out every time my neighbor shows up at my door dressed up in his astronaut gear!.... God I wish he'd stop doing that.... 	1306716668
Our ignorance is growing remarkably fine grained. While the number of things we don't know grows bigger, the importance and usefulness of our new discoveries grows smaller, especially in the fields that form the real "foundation". So you can say "look at all this stuff we don't know" in a lot of cases, a lot of it seems to be little more then fine tuning of the big things we already learned more then anything.\n\nI could be wrong of course, that is the nature of the "unknown". But, if we have physics and mathematics pretty well mapped out, it puts some pretty clear limiting factors on what can be done in other fields that study higher order phenomenon.	1348703800
Yes, but in the process of scientific inquiry, personal experience is practically useless.  Yet, as individuals it is the the most convincing form of evidence.	1335062746

Good, so demonstrate where tax money is going directly to private schools.\n\nThe whole point of a voucher system is that it's indirect.  You get a choice where to spend your education money.  No different than college, really.\n\nJust because you and I don't agree with what is being taught at a handfull of schools doesn't change that fact.  \n\nThe voucher system is more democratic than funneling all kids through the failing public school system.  I find it just as offensive that my tax money supports that institution as well.\n\nI'd prefer a nation of independent schools that competed for voucher-money over the broken top-down, facts-only, system we have today.\n\nChristian fundamentalism is receding anyway.  I know that may be hard to believe but the fact that those wheels are so squeaky lately means that the mainstream is winning the long fight.  \n\nThey had a great last gasp with taking over the GOP but you only have to look at this year's primary to see how shoddy shape they've gotten themselves into.  Even if Romney wins, it will be more because the economy still sucks than anything else.\n\nYou can't fight the internet, tv, radio, etc forever.

Well, there is the theory that *nothing* exists in any kind of physical, 3-dimensional form, and that what we experience as "the universe" or "the real world", might only be a holographic projection of information on a 2-dimensional skin.\n\nAnd this isn't some "what if the Matrix was real" stoner idea, but [a^1](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/holometer-universe-resolution/) [real^2](http://www.technewsworld.com/story/72804.html) [theory^3](http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2011/07/are-we-living-in-a-holographic-universe-this-may-be-the-greatest-revolution-of-the-21st-century.html). Put simply: "the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a boundary to the region—preferably a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon" from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle).\n\nLast I heard it was looking doubtful, if not completely disproven, but there you go: the real world could be a hallucination.	1324996825

If that were true it would be possible to develop and apply scientific theory (formulate a hypothesis and confirm or disprove it through controlled experiments). This simply does not exist for the supernatural. \n\nCertainly there are things that science cannot explain; that is nothing new.

You are right, of course, but it's only slightly less bad for you than table sugar. It's best to just use moderation when consuming either HFCS and sucrose.

When I was on oxycodone and morphine at the hospital I could do the same thing. I had just had back surgery and so it hurt to move an people had to be very gentle around me. Anyway my family was visiting me one day and my grandma was standing at the end of my bed holding my baby nephew. I was propped up with pillows but very sleepy so I shut my eyes momentarily but it was as if I didn't shut them at all. With them closed I saw my grandma putting my nephew at the foot of my bed which of course she wouldn't have done. But it felt so damn real until I opened my eyes and she was still standing there as before. My medication also gave me lucid dreams within lucid dreams. I had consistent false awakenings through each night of sleep it was the most bizarre experience in my life but I suppose it wouldn't be considered a glitch since it was brought on by medication. 	1342039396

I think it might be because he doesn't do any of the stereotypical gay things.

I disagree. Personal anecdotes to not indicate sound reasoning.  I dont blame the woman for making a post hoc judgment on homeopathy, but it in no way make her reasoning valid.  I realize that my experiences may not represent factual occurrences or provide me with enough evidence to make a rational judgment.  That is why we have the scientific method. to test these claims.  And my point was not to address the woman's claims it was to address your statements.\n\nSay for instance I have a sore on my leg, but after whacking my hand with a hammer the sore goes away.  Does that mean the hammer treated the sore? No, and it is irrational for me to think so.  just because something happens after something else does not mean that the first thing was the cause. Belief does not enter into it.  Believing something to be true does not make it so.	1277670874

1. I said well more than 2000 calories a day. Most days were between 2500-3000.\n\n2. I have just recently stopped counting calories in the last few weeks. Only kept track because it's part of tracking macros.  \n\n3. At least the first 3 studies cited in your link are old and based on a tiny number of subjects. \n\nWhile a calorie is a calorie outside of the human body, we do have different ways of metabolizing the various macro-nutrients we ingest.\n \nEven beyond that, your initial point was that people doing paleo or keto aren't losing weight because of eating healthier foods, only less calories, [because they are more easily satiated by the foods they eat](http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/7/1/85. What you are overlooking is that they are probably more easily satiated because those foods are more healthy (containing what the body is looking for). Therefore they are possibly losing weight from eating more nutrient dense/healthy foods that prevent them from over eating (more calories). So really, it's kind of both more healthy/less calories.	1349307193

Quick point, because hobofats pointed out flaws in a lot of your points already, but even though we don't have ice cores going back more than a few hundred thousand years (yes, hundreds of thousands, not merely thousands. I went to the National Ice Core storage facility in Golden Colorado, talked to the climatologists there as part of a geology class), but we can also get a reasonable estimate of paleoclimate using paleontology, going back hundreds of MILLIONS of years.\n\nI'm a geology major with a focus in Paleo, and this is actually a very common thing to do. It's possible to do using Leaves and paleoecology, it's possible to do using foraminifera and the ratios of O18 to O16 incorporated into their bodies, and it's possible to do with several other marine organisms as well. \n\nSo in reality, we have accurate temperature data going back hundreds of millions of years. \n\nAnd when you say that earth is 4.5 billion years old, keep in mind that the majority of that period is the Hadean and the Archean periods, where the earth was still forming, and was basically a volcanic wasteland. Climate data from those periods would have absolutely no relation with climate today. So really we are only looking at 2.5 billion years, and the hundreds of millions of years worth of climate data is a pretty decent percentage of that time.	1292266210

&gt; From a PRA (probable risk assessment) perspective, the chance for core damage is something between 1E-6 and 1E-7/reactor year.\n\nWhich, incidentally, also makes any core damage accident an incredibly strong evidence that PRA is flawed and/or irrelevant to real world.\n\nPRA, essentially, evaluates a few long winded scenarios (which are huge conjunctions), and obtains a low probability, as long conjunctions are unlikely. The resulting small number, mathematically, represents low probability that any one of the specific guesses at a chain leading to an accident is correct, multiplied by probability of incident which remains unknown. The number is then presented as low probability of the accident itself.	1355530429

Pointing out drugs that have been recalled proves nothing about testing and safety requirements. There could be a list of "Drugs blocked due to safety concerns" and it could be 100x longer. That's like saying that because Firestone has to recall some tires, the entire quality control regulation system is obsolete and ineffective. Additionally, there has been a *huge* increase in prescription drug use across the board, as well as a similar increase in the variety of drugs on the market. It's only natural that the amount of drugs being recalled would increase with it. What we want to see is a decrease of drugs being recalled *relative* to the increase in drugs entering the market.\n\nWhile there is certainly a problem with big pharma pushing through drugs that may not be proven completely safe, to suggest that the technology and our knowledge of medicine used to determine safety and efficacy of a drug hasn't progressed since the 1960s is absurd.	1341966131
&gt; A few of them died because they have undergone this instead of seeking more urgent medical treatment.\n\nThat *is* a problem in lots of quackery and pseudoscience - that they claim they alone hold the answer and that you become *unclean* and thus unsaveable if you follow scientific medicine.\n\nBut you are right, the site is biased. What it does is trying to be a counterbalance to all those "natural cancer survivor" anecdotes and testimonials of "how homeopathy healed my diabetes" - because those people are usually only the lucky ones on the normal distribution. And when do you hear the testimonials of the less fortunate...?	1329056092

I would guess that your windows aren't so great or they were not installed properly. Have the nights been especially windy lately? A swift breeze could get the blanket swaying, another one could push it over the bedpost.\n\nWow, I just read your whole story. You have clearly experienced something for which you can't find an explanation. However, the fear you are experiencing can cause you to jump to wrong conclusions. I hope, in this case, it's just the wind.\n\nRegardless of your diagnosed mental health, it's important to hold on to it. Treat odd occurrences as you would a criminal on trial: innocent until proven guilty. Otherwise, you could find yourself in constant anxiety.\n\nPeople deal with these events in different ways. Your aunt is a good example of this. Religion labels these phenomena, says that they are evil and gives people tools to overpower the evil. Personally, I think it's on you to deal with your own fear. Christianity is more like a coping mechanism. If you need religion to do it, okay. However, I don't think there's much accuracy in modern Christianity's view of the paranormal. Further, affirming faith in Jesus' cleansing blood and his promised afterlife is a bit of a sacrifice to mental health, if you ask me.\n\nIf you want some less biased information about spiritual realms, look to the Native American tradition. The themes of trees and lights lead me to believe there is an "Indian" involved. This is mere speculation.\n\nUltimately, again, it's up to you to deal with reality and anything in it causing you fear. Luckily, you are capable of overcoming fear yourself and that seems to be "its" only power over you.\n\nAnother thing... I don't really subscribe to any common psychical theories, but could you perhaps be empathic? According to some theories, empathic mediums send/receive emotions to/from others. I have no reason to believe this is a real ability, but it would explain some of your feelings, especially in relation to your friend (who has also seen a Dr.?).

The shadow apparently cast on the air is the first thing I noticed, too.

The flash also fired. This is a pretty common formula for digital "ghost photos." Obviously the girl was there, and the person writing just didn't notice.

Well that sounds plausible, except there was no sign at all of a third craft after the light flashed. I observed the two planes for ~20 seconds or less after this as they moved out of sight behind trees.

All three objects were elevated at perhaps a 45 degree angle in the sky from my position.	1305399373
&gt;we die, and for the first time the effect of homeopathy will be proven\n\nAirtight logic right there. No disputing it. \n\nHere's my problem with the "skeptical" attitude towards homeopathy. If people want to use homeopathic remedies, that is *their choice*. \n\nMy aunt was a new age-y, tea leaf diving, crystal toting lesbian. When she got colon cancer, she opted for homeopathic treatment. When she died, she died treating her disease in the way she had chosen. \n\nThe ethical question of certain "remedies" being marketed in misleading ways is valid, but the same is true of pharmaceutical medications, SSRIs (anti-depressants) for example, which recent studies have shown are profoundly ineffective. 	1310159898

This is exactly why I hate Occam's Razor: The phony intellectual's trendy argument of the year.  And go easy on the "grave"'s and the "thoroughly"'s.  I know you think they make you sound smart, but "fasle" doesn't.\n\nAnyways, back to Occam's Razor and Penn &amp; Teller.  That fat, lumbering, loudmouthed shitdick forgot a few things:\n\n1. Recoil\n2. Marksmanship\n3. Difficulties of the bolt action\n4. Resetting your whole stance, grip, body (therefore having to reset your aim with over two dozen axises) between each shot\n5. Using a small diameter telescopic scope, which when combined with a bolt action makes it very difficult to track targets, especially behind cover.\n6. The fact that it is an old fashioned telescopic scope, which means that if your eye is not *dead center*, the reticule will be off to the side, making you miss entirely.  This is very hard to pull off when leaning halfway out a window and pulling off repeat shots while tracking.\n7. The odd angle being shot from\n8. Even if he was a psychopath intending to kill the president, he'd be nervous as hell.\n9. The time it takes for your eyes to refocus to the scope between each shot.\n10. It's Penn &amp; Teller.\n\nIf you were to apply Occam's Razor at all, you'd see that it's simpler and more self-satisfying to watch a video of a couple douchebags that lie for a living than going to a shooting range and learning for yourself.  Let me guess, you're the sort of guy who's impressed when Keith Olbermann uses foppy language in his phony rage monologues right?	1241175047

&gt; Wearing clothes?\n\nA long time ago, an old friend of mine (who is ancient now if he's still alive; haven't seen him in years) told me of a mission trip he went on and they went to a tropical culture which never invented clothes.  It was about 75-85 year round, the bugs weren't bad, they never invented clothing.  Well, once they saw the idea of clothes, they started making their own, some of which were extremely fantastically decorated.  They made tops that were just sleeves, for example, leaving the torso uncovered, because they had no sense of modesty as we do about women's breasts.  But while clothes were fun and exciting, it was agreed that people were coming to church in their finery to show off how fancy their clothes were, and that wasn't the right attitude for going to church.  SO, they banned clothes from church: at church, you go naked, because that's proper and decent.  You wear your showoff clothes anywhere you like, but at church everybody does things the conservative traditional way and is naked.\n\nSO: where I live, where it's cold much of the year (and I tolerate it less as I get older), and a blazing sun on my pasty skin much of the rest, wearing clothes is not at all an indoctrinated thing I don't notice: it's necessary.  But there are people whose world - and view of it - is different.\n	1329960882

One thing that the skeptics forget, is that it is in true skeptical form to doubt the 911 official story. That is what a skeptic does, challenge the popular notion, whatever that may be. Another is that both camps, truthers and skeptics alike, believe the other to be blind to the facts. Skeptics have the ability to own their argument to the exclusion of all others. Truthers are no different. Both are blinded by their own over arching belief. 	1316199241
To reiterate: As I *originally perceived* your comment (having issue with "Your personal definition has no bearing on the reality of what it all is.") it made sense to use such language, such that the main point was glossed over by the use of "rude language". \n\nFurthermore, just because someone isn't actively fondling your balls while making an argument does not make them rude, or a jerk. A more likely scenario is that they see the poster they are replying to as stupid or inferior and thus are less likely to respond in a manner that would be reserved to those of equal or greater intellectual standing. \n\nDoes that make that behavior "right"? Probably not. To the person making that comment the behavior is likely "justified" though. \n\nTL;DR: Was his comment rude? Yes, it was harsher than it needed to be. I would have responded in an almost identical fashion to someone who posted something to ignorant though, (and judging by the disparity between the votes on the two posts, I am likely not the only one) so I suppose I am biased in that remark. 	1319472211
Yeah, I'm pretty much arguing over semantics and I am subscribing a particular definition, which would be "UFO" as defined in Project Bluebook. Which to paraphrase states that for a UFO to be considered such there **must** be enough data to rule out **all** known prosaic explanations. If it *could* be something we know about, then that is what it is, case closed. This is a strict criteria which nullifies most UFO sightings and gets rid of misidentified objects. Still, you are right about "UFO's" association with Aliens, which invites ridicule, so I'd be up for UAP or AAP to combat that association. These terms are not nearly as loaded, and my attempts to limit the term UFO to Project Bluebook's definition is futile at best.	1312977116
Summary of his arguments:\n\nFirstly, some of the trees filmed being knocked over by a-bomb testing were planted in neat rows.  Therefore, nukes don't exist.\n\nSecondly, "atomic bomb" blasts look slightly different depending on what angle they're viewed from, and much of the footage was crudely edited, therefore nukes don't exist.\n\nThirdly, the cameras they used to film these were well-secured, sheltered and probably zoomed in a long, long ways.  Therefore, nukes don't exist.\n\nFinally, governments lie about other countries having weapons of mass destruction.  Incidentally, all of these are lies because, as we've already proven three times, nukes don't exist.  Incidentally, all the damage that has been attributed to these non-existent weapons was actually done by dynamite, because I can't tell the difference and neither can you.  This paragraph counts as another reason nukes don't exist because I wear size 36 pants.	1317150175

Guys, the CIA killed Kennedy to escalate Vietnam and fake the moon landings. \n\nThe moon landings were faked so everyone would be watching their TV the day the Roswell aliens came back to pick up their wrecked ship at Area 51. \n\nThey took the aliens and their advanced energy technologies. Without this technology the U.S. needed more energy. \n\nThis is why they planned in the 1980's to invade Iraq in 2003. The way to do this? 9/11: an inside government job. \n\nThis invasion allows the U.S. to get oil, lay down chemtrails while people are busy out protesting, and then elect a secret Muslim president. \n\nThis secret Muslim (born in Kenya) will now help to start with a New World Order using FEMA (an organization George Bush made very incompetent looking [intentionality of course so no one would suspect them] thanks to the secret weather control machine disaster that was hurricane Katrina).\n\nWhen the NWO comes it will mark the beginning of the end times in 2012. \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to go buy some colloidal silver from Alex Jones. 	1285361347

Unfortunately there is no concrete way to say "It isn't an orb, it's something else" without coming off as a complete douchebag, but in my opinion, I have to say these all resemble dust motes, pollen, and the odd bug.\n\nI do not "believe" in orbs, because short of a baseball-sized floating light hovering in front of me and stating "I am the ghost of the man who was killed on this trail," I don't find any supernatural evidence for their existence.  Nine times out of ten an orb may simply be a flare of light off of a dust spec or pollen pod.\n\nEven if you have a "nice camera" and got a shot of a bug or pollen in another photo that is obviously a bug or pollen, you can't discount these things in all future shots.  Even the nicest camera is going to have photos where you can't recognize a human being in the picture due to various bits of interference.	1348250139

Can I get a second chance? Let's start from scratch. \n\nIn my *not* professional understanding of the situation, WTC 7 fell without all the massive internal fires because of a simple reason:\n\nBeing **so** close to ground zero, it suffered *massive* structural damage when the towers fell. When a large part of the structure (including many load-bearing columns within it) were compromised by falling debris and rubble that emanated from WTC 1/2 falling, it was only a matter of time before it fell. \n\nI could be *highly* mistaken, and I would appreciate someone correcting me if I'm wrong, but I am under the impression that once they got everyone out of WTC 7 the building was determined to be unsalvageable and was demolished. \n\nAgain, I haven't put thought into this in a long time, so I could be wrong about the second part. But the first part I'm pretty sure is the case. Again, it's been a while. \n\nSorry I was an ass. :-/	1345561602

Holy crap that video was great.   I never really considered that the reason religious belief, as opposed to belief in other things (e.g. Elvis being alive), has been so protected from criticism is because of man's history of persecuting people over religion.

That may indeed be true, and that is a reasonable *hypothesis*; but (a) it sounds suspiciously like the "irreducible complexity" of Intelligent Design and other false foibles of sophisticated mathematical models and (b) it goes against (what i perceive to be) the nearly universal trend in the sciences toward greater predictive power through mathematization. So, i would submit that additional evidence is called for on those (albeit rather philosophical) grounds, *even if* one can demonstrate that the vast majority of mathematical economic models inept.	1334685603

Those are great photos, but who's to say they aren't man-made?  It's too difficult to tell.  Here is the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMinnville_UFO_photographs) on its debunking as a hoax:\n\n"In the 1980s two UFO skeptics, Philip Klass and Robert Sheaffer, would argue that the photos were faked, and that the entire event was a hoax. Their primary argument was that shadows on a garage in the left-hand side of the photos proved that the photos were taken in the morning rather than in the early evening, as the Trents had claimed. Klass and Sheaffer argued that since the Trents had apparently lied about the time the photos were taken, their entire story was thus suspect.  They believed that the Trents had suspended the "UFO" from power lines visible at the top of the photos; and that the object may have been the detached rear-view mirror of a vehicle. When Sheaffer sent his studies on the case to William Hartmann, Hartmann withdrew the positive assessment of the case he had sent to the Condon Committee. However, Dr. Maccabee offered a rebuttal to the Klass-Sheaffer theory by arguing that cloud conditions in the McMinnville area on the evening of the sighting could have caused the shadows, and that a close analysis of the UFO indicated that it was not suspended from the power lines and was in fact located some distance above the Trent's farm; thus, in his opinion, the Klass-Sheaffer theory was flawed."	1344002405

From the article: "Why did the Pentagon not solve the case at the time? Perhaps in the welter of paperwork the clue we found so significant went unseen by anyone who could fully grasp its import and who had time to devote to the case.

Maybe add in a little over zealous CW-era secrecy to the mix.	1331668590
Well yes, but that presupposes that it is actually we the consumers who want the cars. What if we've been told that cars are the only way, and that we must replace that car every year to boot? Perhaps the proper answer to moving people isn't cars at all, it is automated rapid transport that never has lethal accidents, doesn't pollute, is nearly noiseless and is powered by renewable energy. ;) \n\nBottom line here being of course - it is not nearly enough to "understand economics" (and I'm giving everyone a huge pass on that one, because I would submit that virtually nobody understands every aspect of that particular game) - to claim that capitalism is the only way requires you to have encyclopedic knowledge of societal forces, human psychology, human genetics and so on and so forth. \n\nIt is not enough to know how to fix the engine. 	1296575448

&gt;Ok, I have a serious problem with the "unintentional support" because it makes it someone's fault that they're unconsciously doing something wrong and gives you a tool to blame them for the wrongdoing.\n\n*People* aren't to blame, their opinions, beliefs, and actions are. If a building foreman unintentionally promotes unsafe work practices on his building site, don't you think it's reasonable to try to educate him *as well as* the people who intentionally create unsafe workplaces?\n\nThe main problem is that nobody wants to accept that they're hurting people by just going about their lives, but unfortunately unless these people start understanding and accepting the role that privilege plays in their lives, they will be hurting people. \n\n&gt;When someone says "can we not levy accusations of how unnamed skeptics are harassing women and actually evaluate the anecdotes on their merits," I have trouble seeing that as sexist.\n\nThere's nothing inherently problematic with that approach, but the problem arises in how it is actually done in practice. That is, it usually involves explaining away the problem as a result of privilege blindness. For example, in the 'elevatorgate' case, people made comments like, "Maybe he was actually just asking you back for coffee!" or "He asked you for coffee, you said no, and nothing bad happened - where's the problem?!". As I'm sure you agree, those statements are just as bad as the example you give of the guy blaming the situation on the woman's clothing. 	1348025538
&gt;Since Climate Sensitivity is most likely around 3C,\n\nIt is true that 3C is the *central estimate* of most climate scientists. When you say "around 3C" I assume that you mean "give or take a degree. The range of uncertainty is still pretty large.\n\n&gt;however it is NOT true to claim the global output is currently declining.\n\nYep, you are correct.  Global output is climbing.  Why I said "by reducing our output" I wasn't talking about everyone on the planet.  Obviously, the developing countries are not reducing output.  Europe, in general, is, as is the US.\n\nIF there is something to worry about, if the positive feedbacks from albedo and water vapor combine to more than triple the effects of CO2 alone, I suggest you start working on changing the behavior of the countries that have decide to ignore your warnings and continue to increase their emissions.\n\n	1356200121

Perry was a bit wooey when it came to climate change, which offended me greatly, but he was great for the dynamic. I feel his loss when I listen to the show still.\n\nI wish he could have seen the [birds vs monkeys scene in Rio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fhQ5rkcY7A).\n\nHaving said that, spreading the word about other good skeptical podcasts:\n\nI personally find that Dunning's politics leak a bit into his skepticism.\n\nAs does Mark Crislip's, but when Mark does it he doesn't suggest that it's a correct or even good politics. Therefore I recommend Quackcast as supplementary listening.\n\nHumour is very sensitive to cultural background, so YMMV, but I currently find "Skeptics with a K" the best listening.	1346192605

I have had ghostly experience when I was back home overseas and I have had a UFO experience also. And it was most unusual experience ever. I remember it because I couldn't sleep properly that whole night. I woke up at one point but not opening my eyes i could hear movement in my room. My room is relatively small and I didn't have any pets during that time. At that moment I remember telling myself not to open my eyes. A lot of the other stuff is hazy but I also remember when they left. I heard loud and I mean ringing loud mechanical noises for like a several minutes. Get this also, we have an air force base close by and for the next two months I could hear planes and helicopters flying around every night and evening. It's only happened once and during that period. Otherwise, it would only be like once a month when you would hear a plane fly by at night. 	1339505927

i don't think it's disinformation so much as a grant. While in the end it serves the same end in that it misleads the public, its main purpose seems to be focused on the act of seeking, thus giving the general public what they want, whereas a disinformation campaign would actively deny the existence of extraterrestrial life. I'm aware that  SETI is used as evidence against visitors, but I think that its disinformation potential is intrinsic to its existence, not how it is portrayed. A small distinction, I know, but I hold that the project is well-intentioned, just too limited in scope due to technological/physical limitations- if that makes any sense.	1323234688
Any ideas what it could be? More information about the sighting would be handy. We see three clips. The red lights on the "left" side are blinking", by standards the light on the left wing of the aircraft is red, but they shouldn't be blinking. Anyway we see some strong aberrations probably from looking through the window, but they don't explain the blinking. Probably the blinking is from the stroboscopic light on the bottom of the craft. The objects don't show any unusual movement. 95% airplanes.	1340244184

Science can fall into 4 different categories:\n\n1. Reproducible\n\n2. Predict but can't control- example would be an eclipse\n\n3. Can't predict, can't control but can catch "random" events and record data if we have equipment in the vicinity and at the ready- example would be earthquakes\n\n4. Activity that involves sentient beings- such as car accidents.  We can't set up cameras everywhere to catch car accidents (that would be very inefficient), the best we can do is arrive after the fact, take witness testimony, measure skid marks, etc to arrive at what happened.\n\nYou can't expect to come at the UFO phenomenon using 1 or 2.  The best we can hope for is to get lucky with number 3 (which has happened with the more reliable UFO cases in history involving photographic evidence and testimony).  And, of course, UFOlogists do number 4 all of the time.	1312461437

Read The Moral Landscape. He denies that he is attempting to come up with a science of morality. The subtitle "How Science Can Determine Values" is just there to sell books. \n\nIf you disagree, then simply link me to the experiment that demonstrates that valuing well-being (or having a distaste for suffering) is the best moral value to adopt. Harris can't do that, and that's why he waxes philosophical in the Moral Landscape, regurgitating the same arguments for utilitarianism that had been rejected centuries ago. \n\nScience can *inform* our morality, in that once we've decided what we should value, and what moral system we wish to adopt, we can use science or logic to figure out what are the best methods for achieving these goals, but science can never tackle the questions of morality (i.e. what we should value). Importantly, this is how morality has been done practically since the beginning of time (with "science" in early times being something closer to empiricism and experience), in that no moral system has denied the validity of using science to help answer moral dilemmas. \n\nAnd fuck I wish people would stop citing Sam Harris. There is a reason why his book got slammed by both ethicists and scientists. If Harris had really demonstrated that science can answer questions of morality, then he would have revolutionised the entire field of ethics, and would be a hero in the field. Instead, when the ethicists managed to stop laughing for long enough, his book was met with solid and damning criticism. Even first year philosophy students could see the gaping holes in his theories. 	1340075878

The example is that most people have a false memory that they witnessed the second tower collapse on TV about an hour after watching the first one collapse on TV. The memory is false because no news organization aired the collapse of the second tower until almost 24 hours later. What's interesting is that our brains fabricated a believable memory to fill in the "missing" information of the second tower collapsing. \n\nI can see similarities with this experiment, at least to some degree. These people are asked to write down their belief. What they write is altered without them knowing and they are asked to read aloud what they wrote. If the subjects don't recognize the error, their brains build false memories to support what they wrote (because they know they wrote what they're reading). Apparently, this means you can (at least temporarily) defend opposite positions of morality as if you actually held those beliefs. \n\nEDIT: Not sure why I'm downvoted for info from a TED talk. Anyway, here's a [Psychology Today article](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hidden-motives/201203/unreliable-memory) to corroborate what I stated about how we store memories.	1348165606

That doesn't change the fact that for you personally, the belief is essentially unfalsifiable.  You are never going to be given that huge list of planets with favourable conditions.  You're never even ever going to find out what kind of conditions are necessary to favour the formation of life.  There is no possible evidence that can be given to you that will falsify your belief.\n\nYou're in exactly the same camp as I am here.  Our belief in alien life is not evidence based, and it's not falsifiable.  We believe in alien life in essentially the same way that other people believe in God.	1290623711

&gt;Raxlen had been accused of telling a woman dying of Lou Gehrig's disease that she had chronic Lyme disease, an illness that might not even exist.\n\n&gt;Lyme disease is real. The bacterial infection, chiefly transmitted by deer ticks, can cause rashes, swollen joints and inflamed nerves, and usually is curable with a round of antibiotics.\n\nWait, what? Does it exist or doesn't it? The journalist doesn't seem to have a very good grasp of how to use words to express ideas clearly.\n\nThere is a big difference between misdiagnosing something as Lyme disease, and Lyme disease not existing at all.\n\nThe article starts off rather hyperbolic it seems.\n\n**Addendum**\n\nAh I think I see that the difference is between *chronic* Lyme disease, and Lyme disease. With chroic Lyme disease being something that has very poor evidence in support of its existence.\n\n**Addendum**\n\nHave read the article, worth reading. Quack doctors and others diagnosing people with *chronic* Lyme disease, and keeping them on antibiotics for long periods of time, costing them lots of money and also helping to evolve resistant bacteria that goes on to cause further problems. Also many of these quack doctors have been disciplined or even have criminal records related to misdiagnosing people with chronic Lyme disease.	1292038700

I cannot express how tedious it is to have to explain again and again how the scientific use of the word "theory" is *not* the same as its general use counterpart.\n\nIn order for something to reach the level of a scientific "theory," it must have undergone such review and have been bolstered by enough evidence that for all intents and purposes it very much *is* a fact. \n\nGo test the theory of gravity by jumping off a bridge. Or how about the theory of cells. Sure, we can observe them with a microscope, but it's still "just a theory," eh? How about the *theory* of plate tectonics? I could go on and on. The point is that a theory is a fact. **Theory is the pinnacle of scientific certainty.** That's as far as it gets - it's as close as scientists will ever come to saying "This is the way it is and there's about a zero percent chance of us being wrong about it." Whether or not you have taken it upon yourself to do enough research to agree with them is unimportant. \n\n&gt; Secondly, scientists who do not back evolution are not necessarily acting out of a religious faith. Assuming that says more about yourself than the scientists.\n\nWhere exactly does the word "faith" appear in the comment you replied to? Or were you referring to another comment in which I used it as a *direct response* to someone else who had used it first in a context unrelated to religion? I haven't mentioned religion *once* in this discussion. Perhaps your proactive defense suggests more about *your* thinking than the thing I didn't say says about mine.	1336767434

But to be fair we are just one of many random possibilities.\n\nAs for what I think he's implying with "humanity" he's still wrong. Man kinds knowledge and morality did evolve. We no-longer condone a number of things people did in the biblical past, morality evolved and slowly spread across the population. As to did knowledge. In fact knowledge is a very good example of this. Countless great ideas have been lost through them not becoming widespread.\n\nFor example, the romans had steam power. So Why did it take till 1500 years after the fall of the roman empire for steam power to become widespread? Because of the propagation of knowledge is exactly the same as the spreading of genetic information. The fall of the roman empire caused the great network of knowledge they had nurtured to be splintered in to warring factions.\n\nHumanity has been needlessly delayed by the lack of free knowledge since the dawn of time, now that international academic groups exist and the internet is helping spread knowledge it's getting better. And becoming very hard to deny natural selections impact beyond genetics and it's application to every day life.\n\nWould europe have come to the aid of libya 500 year ago? Of course not, there was no such thing as human rights, governments and monarchies were too busy trying to keep their own people and neighbouring countries in line. And even if a people did sympathise with them, communication systems would not facilitate a quick enough reaction.\n\nThe pope and any fundamentalist group are living in a world that is simply out of touch with reality. They're trying to describe the modern world with a vocabulary that is over 2000 years old.	1303680669

&gt;There's also a hell of a lot of data supporting natural sources of CO2 from various sources other than man.\n\nSure, but they *don't explain the current multidecadal trend.*\n\n&gt;If you are indeed old enough to remember the 1970s then you will also recall that global cooling was all the rage back then.\n\nThere were more papers in the 1970s predicting global warming than global cooling. Global cooling was mostly a media phenomenon.\n\nhttp://www.skepticalscience.com/ice-age-predictions-in-1970s-intermediate.htm\n\n&gt;Further, you're taking out of context a scientific concept (greenhouse effect) discovered in the 19th century and implying that we suddenly had a full understanding of the climate back then, \n\nI never implied such a thing. However, it is true that global warming was first theorized in the beginning of the 20th century. Since then we've had confirmation that man-made global warming is indeed a reality.\n\nhttp://www.skepticalscience.com/its-not-us-intermediate.htm\n\nThe rest of your post is just more talking points from denialist website, citing scientists that aren't experts in the field, or whose work (as in the case of Christy) has been shown numerous times to be inadequate.\n\nhttp://www.skepticalscience.com/skeptic_John_Christy.htm\n\nYou're not looking at this rationally. You are simply trying to find validation for your opinion, i.e. that man-made climate change isn't real. I also find it funny that after admitting there was warming, you're still bringing up Climategate (which is about the warming not really being there...). Using out-of-context Climategate e-mails instantly kills any credibility you might have on the issue, and as such I'm not really interested in continuing this discussion with someone who will cite such sources.\n\n**Edit**:\n&gt;I won't downvote you as I assume you did me because I think your points are valid.\n\nI didn't downvote you, though I have to say you're not really adding to the conversation by repeating the oft-debunked talking points from the climate change denial machine.	1342327377

The top of the WSF disappears from the frame because 1) the shuttle is moving forward, and/or 2) the camera is zooming in. If this were an "ice particle," and either 1 and/or 2 is happening, the "ice particle" would increase in size. Which it is not.\n\nAlso, any change in the space shuttle's x or y direction would be apparent in the arm (as the arm is attached to the shuttle) relative to the WSF. Which does not happen. The shuttle is not rolling, it could possibly be moving forward and downwards.\n	1321651562
&gt;I don't understand the value of your analogy. Even if you're trying to say the diagnostic criteria for mental disorders is an inventory of symptoms, that's fine.\n\nThat's what a disorder is; an inventory of symptoms.\n\n&gt;But when comparing them to something like vomiting, you would be comparing the observability, and in that capacity the analogy just doesn't hold. No matter how you cut it, behavioral anomalies will always be more nebulous than the evacuation of someone's stomach out of their face.\n\nHow are they more nebulous? They are just as observable. 	1348293682

&gt;It can only measure statistically\n\nUntrue. Only the social side of psychology deals with statistical trends (social, personality, etc), the rest makes claims through experimental manipulation. \n\n&gt;and ethics stops us from being able to perform a lot of experiments that would shed light on the human mind.\n\nPartly true. Some experiments are impossible because of ethics, but the vast majority are not. Also, keep in mind that psychology is not the study of the *human* mind - there is no emphasis on humans in psychological research. 	1345686261

One interview that immediately comes to mind is the [Major Donald Keyhoe interview by Mike Wallace during the 1950's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxkdCciZMhk). Keyhoe was a board member on [NICAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Investigations_Committee_On_Aerial_Phenomena), as was [Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_H._Hillenkoetter), Director of the CIA. \n\nIt's not exactly an interview, but [General Samford's 1952 press conference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcRtkA1Rmvw) in response to the public's concern for the purported 'flying discs' over Washington DC is also very interesting. In it, he clearly says these objects are not ours and we have "no idea what they are." The earlier historic evidence tends to be much less altered by mass media and pop culture (ie: little green men &amp; X-Files theme music).\n\n&gt; what exactly are we here to promote? \n\nI think we're here to (hopfully) weed through the bad information, the misinformation and put the subject on some solid ground through skeptical and scientific approaches, when possible. \n\n&gt; Is this forum like, "Hey, here's some well documented and credible UFO cases for people to see" or is it like, "OK, we've all subscribed to r/UFOs because we believe there's a shred of truth to this phenomenon. We've seen some cases, and would welcome more, but let's take it to the next step and start talk about what this means for us."\n\nI would say it's a combination of both. 	1312224458

I've had a handful of these.  It's often annoying however, that they're often more abstract, although I have had a couple that were almost perfect visual matches for things I've later seen.  Usually very insignificant events.  One was my cousin being asked to be in a play.  When it happened I kept thinking 'I know I've seen this before.'  Like deja vu but worse.  I eventually remembered a vivid dream I'd had about 2 months before where literally the exact same thing had happened at a theater that as far as I could remember exactly the same as what I was looking at.  Only other one was a party I went to right after a bad breakup.  When I had the dream I had assumed it was just a randomly generated scene, but nope, actually ended up there later.  It was weird even the way the lime green cups were arranged on the table triggered some weird memory of the dream.\n\nI've had a few more, but they were really abstract and while indicative, not necessarily predictive (although much more vivid and memorable).	1342807096
&gt;Since when did the skeptic community become the academic/scientific apologist community?\n\nSince never.\n\n&gt;When science gets something wrong it's ok to point it out.\n\nSure it is. That is the process that has produced AGW theory, which has so far withstood pretty much everything that's been thrown at it, probably because it's very likely to be correct.\n\n&gt;You don't have to toe the line on every issue.\n\nNo one's asking you to. However, the evidence supporting AGW theory is numerous and compelling, and the evidence against it is practically non-existent. Therefore, AGW theory (like Evolution) is very probably true.\n\n&gt;The argument is not over "anthropogenic global warming" it is over catastrophic anthropogenic global warming \n\n"Catastrophic" anthropogenic global warming is a made-up expression that was created by deniers in order to treat this as an emotional issue rather than a scientific one. The word "catastrophic" is both vague and scary, which fits with the climate change denier's goal of making the opposite side look like emotionally-driven alarmists. It may work with those who aren't aware of the actual science, but it won't work with me. Sorry.\n\nIf you disagree, then please provide a precise definition of what "catastrophic" means, and how that definition was achieved.\n\n&gt;Quite simply, there is not anything close to certainty that human contributions to CO2 in the atmosphere will have a major effect on the Earth's climate.\n\nAh, but we don't *need* certainty. If there was even a 50/50 chance that it was correct, given its potential effect it would be foolish not to act.\n\n&gt;There are way too many assumptions being thrown around \n\nNot really. The science is supported by multiple lines of evidence, which suggest a climate sensitivity between 2 and 4.5C, with a likeliest value of 3C. While this may or may not be "catastrophic" (no denier so far has been able to explain to me what "catastrophic" precisely means in this context), but there are various studies that suggest it won't be *good* (including studies from the Pentagon, that nest of eco-terrorists!).\n\nIn any case, I've talked with enough deniers to know that, when caught in their pseudo-science, they'll gladly go from "it's not warming" to "it's warming but it's not us" to "it's warming, it's us but it won't be bad" only to return to "it's not warming".\n\n&gt;Furthermore there is evidence that the Earth's climate is currently in a particularly warm interglacial phase and is due for a return to ice age very soon\n\nNot "evidence", but rather a hypothesis.\n\n&gt;if increased CO2 in the atmosphere helps stave off such catastrophic changes then we will all be grateful for it\n\nWait a minute. Either AGW theory is wrong, and the increase will be minor, or it is right, and the warming will be strong enough to correspond to the decrease in temperature caused by a return to a glacial period (not an "Ice Age", as you incorrectly note, since we are already inside an Ice Age). It can't be both, you'll have to choose what your position actually is - but thanks for demonstrating I was correct about how deniers' arguments aren't consistent with each other.\n\n&gt;I encourage you to apply [1] Feynman's scientific attitude \n\nI am well aware of Feynmann's cargo cult science concept, however it doesn't apply to Climate Science, and Feynmann himself never cited climate science as an example of cargo cult science.\n\nI think you and other deniers who constantly cite Feynmann should be ashamed of tarnishing the memory of a great scientist by suggesting he'd be on your side of this debate (since your side is incapable of producing evidence that AGW is wrong).\n\n&gt;to the claims of those who wish to make wild, unsubstantiated scientific claims in an attempt to tax all economic output, everywhere.\n\nNo one wants to tax all economic output everywhere. That goes beyond a strawman fallacy, right into conspiracy theory. Maybe that's why the subreddit doesn't fall for your pseudoscientific arguments. Sorry.\n\nEdit: there *is* something one could be skeptical about, is that there is a conspiracy to spread disinformation by multinational oil companies. There is evidence of fossil fuel companies financing climate change denial "enablers" (think tanks, blogs, scientists), however this doesn't necessarily mean there's an actual conspiracy to spread lies in order to protect corporate interests; it *could* conceivably just be the product of stupidity rather than malice (and I believe that in many cases it is).\n\nThat's where one could draw a skeptical line, because there is little actual evidence of this (as with most conspiracy theories). The science itself, however, is pretty solid. It's going to take more than vague accusations and oft-debunked arguments to make a serious dent in it.	1342826297

Exactly which facts are being ignored?  The fact that there is practically zero chance of there being a single molecule of the original ingredient at 30C or 200C (homeopathies most potent cure).  Or maybe it's the fact that in double-blind trials there is no significant difference between a homeopathic remedy and a placebo.  If you expect anecdotes to be accepted as fact, then I think you're approaching the topic all wrong because placebos are a powerful thing.  \n\nI'm not claiming that a person who honestly believes something will work, won't feel any relief.  I'm claiming that I could take a dropper of pure distilled H2O, tell someone that it was a remedy for whatever their ailment is, and have the same statistical chance at seeing improvement as you would see with the homeopathic remedy.   \n\nI also do not see the relevance of your referencing Rudolf Steiner.  Nowhere do I see his stance on homeopathy listed, nor do I understand how a philosopher who championed antrhoposophy and spiritual science has any bearing on a discussion of the scientific merits of homeopathy.  There's a reason natural sciences have made progress in the past century, while spiritual science is just as laughable as it ever was.    \n\nYour original question was why do Redditors in general harbor such antipathy for homeopathy.  People are being scammed, by water in a bottle, for 8-10 bucks a pop.  There are real provably working treatments out there that are sitting on the same shelf, but either public ignorance or marketing is keeping these snake oil salesmen in business.  It pisses me off, that in this age where information is literally seconds away this Victorian age mysticism is still profitable.  I suppose it's not that surprising, seeing that Bronze age myths are still going strong too.    	1300729466

Importantly, however, psychopaths’ pattern of judgments on different dilemmas was the same as those of the other subjects. These results force a rejection of the strong hypothesis that emotional processes are causally necessary for judgments of moral dilemmas, suggesting instead that psychopaths understand the distinction between right and wrong, but do not care about such knowledge, or the consequences that ensue from their morally inappropriate behavior.  [...]\n\nhttp://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/01/06/scan.nsp051.full\n\n&gt;. Psychopaths either a) do not have this ability or b) do not care, and therefore do not follow the moral code.\n\nB, actually...but that doesn't mean they don't have a moral code...it just means they don't have YOUR moral code.  \n\nSeriously, this is ridiculous.  You start off by saying "everyone does X, therefore they have Y", I show that not everyone does X.  Your argument now seems to be that, because they don't do X, they don't have Y.\n\n&gt;Also, you're still confusing "pointless" with "pointless murder."\n\nThen define your terms because CLEARLY I'm too fucking stupid to get it.\n\n"Pointless" and "pointless murder" are not scientific terms.  If you want to coin your own terms with your own special meanings, fine, but include your brand new meanings of those terms instead of acting like a smug prick because I couldn't read your fucking mind.\n\n\n&gt;That, in fact, was entirely my argument. Without anything that is infallible or godlike in any way, it is possible to achieve some sort of values that is at least loosely universal among humanity\n\nAnd that's an irrelevant point.  Objective morality needs to be independent of humans opinion in order for it to be objective.  it doesn't matter if ALL humans everywhere hold the same opinion...that still doesn't transmogrify the opinion into fact.  Furthermore, those values are not universal.  It's a secondary point, but one you seem to be stuck on.\n\n&gt;Someone else on this thread (too lazy to actually find/quote it properly, or to see if you've responded to this, so forgive me and/or feel free to slap me for not looking it up) said it best: math does not stop working just because humans are not here. \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/vxicb/it_seems_like_some_of_you_actually_believe_in/c58jzmc\n\nMath exists independently of humanity...morality doesn't.\n\n&gt;Any other sentient, social animal would likely evolve similar social constraints on behavior.\n\nThat's another huge assumption.\n\nEvolution is ambivalent to death...except when death interferes with reproduction.  A society which has no problem brutally murdering the elderly could survive as the elderly are beyond the age of reproduction.  \n\n&gt;Again, I do not in any way advocate moral absolutism, and I seriously doubt anyone on this subreddit does either. But things like that do seem to be as objective as we can get.\n\n"As objective as we get" doesn't mean "objective".  \n\n&gt;Also, just because rape happens does not mean it is "good."\n\n...and my point was that, just because something is encouraged via evolution (and rape certainly is encouraged in this way), it doesn't make it "good".  \n\n&gt;There are enough differences between the scenarios of "rape" and "pointless murder" for me to say that the analogy fails.\n\n\nYou said (way back when):\n\n&gt;&gt;A society that abhors pointless murder (Edit for clarification again, because ambiguity: which, to the best of my knowledge, is all of them societies), on the other hand, will be less likely to wipe itself out. This is an example of something that is not a force or entity in any way, merely a fact of nature. \n\n\nYour argument is basically that something which works against the survival of a species becomes an objective "bad".  I used rape as an example because it works towards the survival of the species (by that same logic making it "good") but it's pretty universally viewed as "bad".  The analogy works, assuming that was your fucking argument.  However, seeing that you seem to have your own weird ass definitions for common words that you pull out of your ass, I may be wrong.  To you, perhaps "wipe itself out" really means "eats lots of ice cream and masturbates to bollywood films".  I really have no idea at this point, but I do know I'm getting tired of this argument.\n\n&gt;So, I'll make it simple: according to your philosophy of morality, Hitler thought he was doing the right thing. Does anybody else have any moral right or obligation to stop him? (Note: I'm not talking about your personal feelings. I'm talking about what moral relativism says about the issue)\n\nMoral relativism doesn't say you should do X or Y...moral relativism says there's not such thing as an objective right and wrong to moral questions.  You can't really demand a moral judgment from something that explicitly denies the validity of moral judgment.\n\nThis is like asking what atheism has to say about praying to god on sundays vs. saturdays. \n\n\nI personally say he's an asshole.  If I had the power and inclination to do it, and thought I wouldn't be punished for it (i.e. I had popular support), I'd kill Hitler if I were given the choice.  But this has not fucking bearing on the existence of objective morality.   I feel like you're only asking this question in the hopes that I'll respond with something along the lines of "what Hitler did wasn't inherently wrong" so you can scream "AHA see!  Clearly you too are an evil person and we need objective morality to avoid more Hitlers!!!".  That's the ONLY way I see this applying to this conversation.\n\n&gt;But they are relative.\n\nAnd relative is subjective.  \n\nThe end.	1341270857

Well, we have evidence in the form of declassified documents that the US generals during WWII, with the approval/request of FDR to figure out a way to force Japan into a confrontation by making life in the Pacific incredibly difficult for them. Whether or not they knew of the impending attack on Pearl Harbor is one question, but what's not in question is that they deliberately instigated an attack to provide the pretense for war.\n\nNot saying what they did was even unnecessary, I happen to agree with the idea in a general sense. But between the Northwoods documents and the documents describing this WWII strategy, we *know* from the historical record that governments are willing to engineer tragedies and outrages so that they can then use them to forward an agenda.	1276701400

Moreover, it's a nutrient, not a medication; it's effect is preventative, not curative (at least as far as fluoridation goes).

I can honestly say CoQ10 works for what I was told to take it for.  I have a broken penis, a toilet seat fell on it when I was younger and damaged the tissue about halfway down my penis.  So yes sometimes it will "bend" when faced with tight circumstances.  However now at age 41 I have a painful hard lump inside my penis.  Hard-ons are severely painful.  I went to the Urologist and he said until he could see me for SHOTS INTO MY PENIS I should take CoQ10.  It does help with the lump size and my penis does not hurt as much.  However I currently have a right angle facing up when I get a hard on.  Lots of fun there.	1345592678

The point is.  These "mysteries" of good health have been known by people for a long time.  We've known that shoes caused these problems and I've practiced barefoot my whole life 28 years.

The problem is that she never admits to fault or being wrong about anything, ever, and she never reassesses her views in light of new information.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown#Neuro-linguistic_programming\n\n&gt;Several authors have claimed that Brown uses neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) in his act which "consists of a range of magical 'tricks', misdirection and, most intriguing, setting up audiences to provide the response that he wishes them to provide by using subtle subliminal cues in his conversation with them."[39] In response to the accusation that he unfairly claims to be using NLP whenever he performs, Brown writes "The truth is I have never mentioned it outside of my book". Brown does have an off-stage curiosity about the system, and discusses it in the larger context of hypnotism and suggestion.[19][40] In his book "Tricks of the Mind" he mentions that he attended an NLP course with Richard Bandler, co-creator of NLP and mentor of Paul McKenna, but suggests that the rigid systems of body language interpretation employed by NLP are not as reliable as its practitioners imply. He also mentions the NLP concept of eye accessing cues as a technique of "limited use" in his book "Pure Effect".[41] The language patterns which he uses to suggest behaviours are very similar in style to those used by Richard Bandler and by the hypnotist from whom Bandler learned his skill, Milton H. Erickson. Brown also mentions in his book 'Tricks of the Mind' that NLP students were given a certificate after a four-day course, certifying them to practice NLP as a therapist. A year after Brown attended the class, he received a number of letters saying that he would receive another certificate, not for passing a test (as he discontinued practising NLP following the course), but for keeping in touch. After ignoring their request, he later received the new certificate for NLP in his mailbox, unsolicited.[42]\n\nBrown doesn't use NLP, and in "Tricks of the Mind" he goes into detail as to why it doesn't work (mostly by discussing all the studies which have been done on the topic that have disproved the practice). 	1328446800

If you think scientific skepticism is just dogmatic rejection, I suspect you have a basic misunderstanding of what we do. Regarding your attitude towards science, it honestly hurts my head. You seem to think theories are useless and presumptuous - that we should "get rid" of them - but they are required to formulate, test, and falsify hypotheses. The models we create are rarely assumed to be fully accurate; they are a way to tie together information.\n\nI encounter this attitude from philosophers often, and it is simply infuriating. (Never from philosophers of science, fortunately, but that doesn't surprise me - they actually understand the basis of the scientific method and the difference between it and a religious framework.) \n\nIt's just as frustrating as the dismissive attitude many scientists have against philosophy, and makes you look like just as much as a dumbass.	1322172879

&gt;&gt;For example, that Osama bin Laden has been killed is not a terribly fantastic or extraordinary claim.\n\n&gt;First of all, this capture has been a decade in the making. Consider: those 20-somethings shown celebrating were still in grade school back on 9-11-2001; American policy has been dominated by this guy (and his cohorts) for their entire conscious lives.\n\nWhat do either of those two things have to do with what you were replying to?   Neither of those things change the fact that the killing of a man by Navy SEALs, using firearms at close range, is not an unreasonable scenario to occur.\n\n&gt;for nearly 10 years the accepted answer was either "he can't be caught" or "he's already dead". \n\nThese are claims made by armchair analysts.  None of us really know what has been going on behind the scenes.  Because most people accepted these "explanations" doesn't give them any more merit.\n\nRegarding your comparison to Saddam, he was discovered and trapped in a hole in the ground, and did not resist capture.  If you are willing to accept that his demeanor at the time of his discovery and Osama's were different enough to warrant different levels of force, than it also stands to reason that the two encounters would have different outcomes.\n	1304698857

I found this story suspicious for different reasons than you.  Mainly, in fact by seeming inconsistencies between the photo and the story.  Maybe I'm wrong, but the child in the photo looks too big to be three months old, and the earth pit they're in doesn't look like the situation described in the text:\n\n&gt; when the rescuers reached the ruins of a young woman’s house, they saw her dead body through the cracks.\n\nWhat cracks exactly?  This pair look like they've been buried.  I don't think this is a rock-solid objection, but for better (skepticism) or worse, it raised an eyebrow with me.\n\nIn any event, our suspicions proved correct, as TaxandSpendDinosaur points out.  And in his source, the image and description match.\n\nSome interesting questions I'd like to see answered about this story is who put the text and image together, and why?  Did they create the text, or take it from somewhere else?  Given certain "red flags" in the text, this looks like it could have been adapted from a miracle-anecdote of the sort that one's vaguely protestant mother likes to forward to one's email.  And if so, by whom and for what purpose?  Pious fraud, a prank maybe?\n\nPersonally, it's at this point in the story of a fake that things get really interesting to me.	1315935925

Here are some more links to go along with **gazillion**.  From Science Based Medicine blog there is Chiropractic and Stroke: An evaluation of one paper(\\(http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/chiropractic-and-stroke-evaluation-of-one-paper/\\)) by Mark Crislip.\n\nAnother article came up from QuackWatch by Stephen Barrett, M.D. entitled - [Chiropractic's Dirty Secret:\nNeck Manipulation and Strokes](http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chirostroke.html)\n\n&gt;Do you really think all major insurance companies and corporations would include chiropractic in their plans if it didn't work and save them money?\n\nThe fact that an insurance company will pay for chiropractic care does not make it safe or effective.  Many insurance companies cover acupuncture too.  What's his take on this. \n\nI find it odd that he didn't list the sources for the opiate and Tylenol deaths.  And how many of those deaths were accidental vs. suicide vs. other.  Automobiles and medications have both helped a lot of people lead better lives.  Cars help people earn a living and support themselves, medications can help a person lead a better life, anti-depressants for example or antivirals for HIV patients.\nBut he would be hard pressed to tell me that more people die from medications in one year than they do from car accidents.  I don't see him extolling the evils of cars.  Medical doctors will tell the patient of possible complications, almost to a ludicrous point.  Chiropractors rarely if at all will tell a patient that what they are doing may cause serious harm. \n\nI understand his frustration from being criticized, my father was a chiropractor, but honestly, they bring the criticism on themselves.  From odd and poorly explained "medical devices" and their resistance to integration with proven medical practices to their extreme views on medications and vaccines, they bring it all on themselves.  	1315171356

No, I agree not from our government.

I mean there are plenty of things they should be doing and yet the paradigm remains locked in 18th century post enlightenment. At risk of kicking at a dead horse - it's about the money, like the climatologist who quit recently. \n\nLast month, I saw a bunch of UFOs flying across the sky in broad daylight. As hard as I try to id them, I have no idea what they were: 15-20 dark shapes I couldn't identify - it was weird. And yet I risk being labeled crazy for talking about it. Anything that changes that mentality is a good thing - that doesn't mean I trust a single word they say, its a process. To me government and science are exactly the same thing. Science is getting sanitized. 	1288921684
I agree with him about his point that you cannot determine an individual’s mental health simply by comparing them against a flawed definition of what is ‘normal’.  The idea that ‘healthy’ and ‘normal’ are the same thing when it comes to mental health brings up issues of semantics, I think.  And he is certainly not the first person to raise this kind of issue.\n\n“It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” — Jiddu Krishnamurti\n\nThough I agree with this sentiment, the takeaway is not that anyone who is labeled mentally ill is is actually mentally fit.  A ‘sick society’ may label someone ill when they *are* in fact ill (by objective measurements).  So too, a fit individual may be labeled sick by this societal measuring stick.  The takeaway, for me, is simply that empirically measuring the mental fitness of every individual (an economically infeasible task, at least at this point in time I should think) may be distinct from what institutions deem ‘normal’.	1322507014

You're correct in that sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate, or more commonly known as [thimerosal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal) is not mercury. Rather than inorganic mercury, which can't pass the blood-brain barrier, [ethylmercury can](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylmercury). This happens to be what thiomersal is metabolized or degraded to in the human body. Thiomersal is not necessary for the vaccine to work, it is simply used as a preservative and continues to be used even though it's being "phased out".\n\nThis being the skeptic board on Reddit, it frustrates me to see such knee-jerk reactions from people who simply believe they are "in the know" about mercury and autism, a subject which remains controversial exactly because it is **unproven to either direction**.\n\nIt's a fact that mercury is one of the most toxic elements known to man, but that in its natural states it's fairly stable and harmless. Vaporize or methylate it though, and you've got an entirely different beast in your hands. While mercury alone can't be linked as a direct cause of autism, it's clear that mercury *always* has a damaging effect on the organic systems it comes to contact with. It's the degree of damage, speed of recovery and interactions with other complex systems that remain under question.\n\nNext time Big Pharma comes spewing propaganda your way, maybe you should take also their message with a grain of salt and look at evidence from both angles. This is how you may find the connections that are masked by your first reactions which may be driven more by emotion than rationality.\n\nThis is neither a pro-vaccine nor an anti-vaccine statement, this is a statement and a plea against preaching of partial knowledge.\n\nYou call yourselves skeptics, now how about you start acting like skeptics?\n	1256407855

That video, though VERY well done. Is also quite fake-looking. In the slow motion part, he reveals himself accidentally. Watch the dots and watch the horizon, they don't shake together. His mistake was filming shaky footage and trying to motion track the dots in there, which unfortunately failed. he should have filmed it on a steadicam and then added shaking in  post-production. \n\nI'm willing to forgive one kind of fake video by a user, but he has two that are noticeably fake to a trained eye.	1331838040

The 100000 ton figure was from a quick googling, and may be wrong. As far as I understand it, steel is an excellent conductor of heat and as such even though the temperature of the steel in the immediate vicinity of the fire would be hotter, the heat would quickly conduct throughout all of the steel columns (which should be connected with metal supports). I believe I recall hearing a claim somewhere that this is one of the reasons why steel-framed highrises have never collapsed due to a fire, even if the fire is much more longer-living and more intense than at the WTC. The entire building is essentially a massive heat sink. Your argument that the heat only affecting the immediate vicinity would mean that the rest of the supporting columns (especially in the case of the North Tower where the plane hit was close to the top) would remain unaffected just a few floors below the fire, and the vast majority of the supporting columns would remain structurally sound.\n\nHeat buckling is a good point, but I think it's irrelevant. As far as I understand the structure of the WTC, the supporting vertical columns were all in the middle, and the floors were supported by steel trusses attached to these columns (and the outer frame). The pancake theory postulates that the connections between the vertical support columns and the steel trusses holding the floors up failed, causing the floor elements to fall and pancake. What about the supporting vertical columns, though? They would remain standing, especially since the floor loads are suddenly removed from them. The connections between the support columns and floor elements would be the weakest link, so the floors going down would not pull the supporting columns down with them but simply cause those connections to fail. Once the floors are down, the force from the wind would probably cause lateral loads that the vertical columns can't support, but the supporting columns would topple, not fall straight down.\n\nA simple representation would be having a tree trunk representing the support columns in the middle, and having wooden platforms attached around it every few meters. If the top platform fails, it simply falls down taking all the platforms with it, but the tree (core columns) remains standing. So, why did the support columns come down with the floors, when the official theory strictly states that the floors were seperated from the support columns and came down on their own? What about the floors above the point of collapse, wouldn't they have stayed up there considering that the supporting columns should have remained standing? \n\n&gt; The tree toppling I think is a bad example here\n\nThe tree toppling thing was the simplest example I could think of. The thing is that since the falling top part of the structure is completely separated from the structure below (assuming the core columns failed as well), if the center of mass is not at the exact center of the impacts, the force of the impacts would impart energy unevenly and thus cause an uneven collapse, especially since practically all of the vertical support is at the center of the building. If the center of gravity moves far enough off-center, this would add rotational energy to the structure above and cause it to roll off the bottom part, actually falling next to the building and leaving the rest of the original building standing.\n\n&gt; The pancaking seen in the collapse is a great example of the occurrence.\n\nAs far as the impacts on each floor slowing the building down, you're correct that at some point the combined mass of the falling floors would be great enough that the impacts would cause negligible speed loss. At the beginning, however, when the speed is slow and the mass difference isn't excessive, this would cause a noticeable thump which is not visible in any of the footage of the incident I've seen (granted, I haven't seen much). Another thing is that several floors down, assuming somehow that the core columns go down as well, the falling structure would start encountering structurally sound vertical columns that are specifically designed to resist vertical loads, and would cause severe resistance in the middle of the falling building. Think a cube of butter dropped onto a vertically standing metal rod, where the diameter of said rod is much lower than that of the chunk of butter. It would spear right through the falling mass.\n\n&gt; The temperature in the wreckage problem...\n\nA few hundred thousand tons of concrete with small pockets of air sounds like a fairly good insulator to me. Assuming for a second that it was thermite, and considering how much of it would have been needed to achieve a controlled demolition, I don't think it is impossible that even though the thermite would have burned out very quickly, the high temperatures and amount of sheer energy it produced combined with the insulation the collapsed buildings provided could have caused the temperature to stay that high for days afterwards. This is just a guess, though. I've also given thought to the offices having some kind of fuel source that could burn hot enough, but quite frankly I can't think of anything in a high-rise building that would burn at temperatures even close to the melting point of steel. This may just be a failure of imagination on my part, though, and I don't think the temperature measurements after the collapse are as interesting as the collapse itself.\n\n&gt; Love your response by the way! Don't know why you got a down vote for it.\n\nI guess it sounded too conspiratorial to some or they disagreed with the physics.	1331319043

Well, YouTube is not the skeptical community, and i agree with a post elsewhere in this thread that the distinction needs to be made. I agree that the authors and readers of Skepchick are very loud and forceful, but i do not see them exhibiting anything like dogmatism — especially compared to Thunderf00t — and [their comment policy](http://skepchick.org/about-2/commenter-code-of-conduct/) gives anyone experiencing harassment in their threads a recourse for it.\n\nAs to whether their complaints have merit, by accusing them of harassment you appear to agree that harassment within the skeptical community is a problem. I've only seen reasoned discussions of it coming from the likes of Watson, [Benson](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2012/06/a-tedious-correction/), and others close to Skepchick and FtB, so i was asking you in hopes of balancing that out. I'm not demanding evidence that it occurs. What i do seriously doubt is that the discussions going on about harassment at Skepchick and FtB are in any way contributing to the problem. You seem to disagree, so i welcome your reasons. Where have they been dogmatic, for example, since it seems clear to you that they are?	1341623653
Thing is anyone can be wrong or make honest mistakes, what matters is admitting those mistakes. And this should have no effect on any previous good things you might have done. We have the idea that one wrong step invalidates your entire life.\n\nI think that a very important thing about being a scientist and a skeptic (and I also don't see how a scientist couldn't be a skeptic) is knowing that you're fallible and prone to error.	1261639843

Some people just have a stronger sense of empathy than others... I understand exactly where you're coming from when you say there's a threshold of ignorance where you find it easy to not care; some people's threshold is just much higher.  I sometimes wonder why other people don't care more about certain things, but I don't think it makes you a bad person to not agree with me on how much one should care.\n\nI personally am very conflicted about these people, because on one hand they're idiots... it's hard to deny that; on the other they're people, mostly just like you and me, who (on a basic human level) think and feel just as we do... I see aspects of other people I've known through out my life, who I wouldn't want to see harmed or distressed (even though they're misguided), and therefore my concern extends to them on that basis.	1306109518

Your co-worker is an idiot, and here's why:\n\nWhich is more likely?  A global conspiracy comprised of hundreds of thousands of individuals of different backgrounds and religious convictions that has *not a single scrap of evidence* to support it - **or** - that they're all following the same scientific method and the conclusions they reach (based entirely on the *abundant* evidence) happen to align against religious history?\n\nApproach it a different way if you need to:  did we know more about the world two thousand years ago than we do now?  Of course we didn't.  Follow that line to its conclusion: religions were attempts to explain the world that spawned from our ignorance.  Science is what has been removing our ignorance, slowly but surely.	1347244630
There are people who disbelieve just because they think the religion sounds stupid. That doesn't make them skeptics. It doesn't even make them rationally justified. There are also people who were born and raised atheist. They don't have to question anything to be atheists.	1354257045

Say, "Hey, your bite still itch?" When she says 'Yeah, a bit." tell her, "That's odd. Cause I've been shooting this laser at  it for the last 5 minutes."	1309892920
&gt;The only interest I have in this conversation is calling you out...\n\nDude, I strongly dislike tv and the entire commercialisation of it. I hate the non-education, the fearmongering and propaganda. I hate it showing what is right and what is wrong, what is beauty and what is to be laughed at. What you need to buy. What you need to think and when you need to think that.\n\nThere is hardly any science and logic involved. Everything is designed to make you watch through the commercials. In TV-business there is a thing called "content" and "filler". Content is the name for the commercials and filler is the name for the shows in between. And no, I didn't mix that up. That's simply they way TV works. Discovery channel included, everything is now 'a camera following guys doing something entertaining'. \n\nStop watching tv is the best advice someone can ever give to a fellow human being. Go read a book. Or if you want to learn about the paranormal, go on the internet and actually read some research. \n\nIf you think that watching ghost lab and the 'funny guys' is going to help you in your life, getting a better understanding of the world and make you happier, you are wrong. Plain and fucking simple. Let's not call it arrogant, let's call it advice.\n	1324326886
[m.xkcd.com](http://m.xkcd.com)	1342274760
I have seen some terrestrial explanations of cattle mutilations.  Those same explanations would seem to be applicable here.  See for example: http://www.skepdic.com/cattle.html.\n\nRelevant quote:\n&gt;Naturalistic explanations in terms of diseases and predators (skunks, buzzards, weasels, etc.), insects (such as blowflies and maggots), or birds are to no avail, even though the most thorough examination of so-called cattle mutilations concluded there was nothing mysterious that needed explaining (Rommel 1980). It is useless to note that insects and animals often devour the vulnerable mucous membranes and the softer parts of dead animals such as the genitalia, instead of  trying to burrow through the cowhide. It is pointless to note that incisions to a carcass by the teeth of  predators or scavengers often resemble knife cuts. It is pointless to note that bloating often leads to skin splitting in straight lines resembling incision and exposing internal organs. It is of no use to point out that there is little or no blood oozing from the wounds because blood settles, the heart does not pump when an animal is dead, and insects devour the blood that does spill out. And it is certainly pointless to describe the experiment done by the Washington County (Arkansas) Sheriff's Department. They placed a dead cow in a field and had observers watch what happened over the next 48 hours. When they reported that bloating led to incision-like tears in the skin and that blowflies and maggots had cleaned out the soft tissue so that the carcass looked exactly like those that had been attributed to aliens or satanic cultists, they were generally ignored by the community of true believers.\n\nI would at least like to see some studies ruling out these possibilities before I accept less probable ones.  The body certainly doesn't look fresh and I didn't see information about how long he was missing before being found.  A lot of the missing parts seem to be things that scavengers find to be particularly tasty - soft tissue.\n\n	1312558539

There are some metaphysical stores that have already dried sage in a bundle and it is called a smudge stick. very easy to find if looking in the right spot. The idea is that burning sage while thinking good thoughts will cleanse the space of unwanted energy and then sprinkle a line of salt in the window sill and door way to keep bad energy from coming back. Old school protection right there. Smudging is something that you can do daily or just as needed. When ever you feel energy present that you don't want present you can burn and think positive. If the sage is not available then just imagine your house in a big bubble of light and ask all energy that isn't good to leave the bubble. Sounds hokey but don't worry about right or wrong just believe in it and it will work. You are working with something that is in the dream world and so are your thoughts. Ergo everything in your thoughts directly effects the invisible. 	1326153829

Well, not *all* their arguments.\n\nThe main reason I try to buy organic is to reduce the amount of herbicides and pesticides (particularly petro-chemical based ones) introduced into the environment.  I buy into co-ops because the farmers I know are good about rotating their crops and growing things seasonally and regionally appropriate, so as to reduce water needs and fertilizer needs.  Modern conventional farming is a thing of wonder, it really is, given the kinds of yields we're getting, but the damage downstream is pretty alarming. It's not long-term sustainable, either. \n\nBuying organic (or local) for environmental reasons gets a little complicated, though, since even organic farms can be practicing non-environmentally sound methods of farming, from wasting water to fertilizers entering the water table, and so on and so forth.   The label's not enough to really know if you're buying what you hope you're buying.  Still, there are certain benefits to buying organic that *is* actually responsibly farmed organic, but good luck finding it. 	1333067713

What I find touching is the absolute conviction of its adherents that they know what happened and everybody else--including and especially those who have studied the era--are dead wrong or that they know the secret and are covering it up. Shakespeare conspirators are sometimes quite clever--some of their theories would put the Illuminati conspiracies to shame--but once you get into their theories you realize they really aren't that bright. What I find poignant is the sheer waste of human life by the true believers. In the early 20th century a [doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orville_Ward_Owen) spent his entire fortune trying to prove that Francis Bacon was the true author, and he realized too late what a fool he had been, warning others on his death bed not to throw away their lives and fortunes as he had done. Of course they didn't listen, because not listening is really the only thing they're good at.\n\nAs far as Emmerich goes, he's only doing what movie directors do: providing entertainment and promoting his film.

&gt;At the same time, many who self-identify as Christian hold beliefs that some churches would consider to be incompatible with traditional Christian teaching, such as astrology and reincarnation (27% in each case), ghosts (36%) and fate (64%).\n\nIt's bizarre to me how many Christians believe this nonsense, I knew a girl who identified as Catholic who was heavily into numerology, another practise that the church frowns on. She also didn't accept evolution because she thought that the Catholic church was opposed to it, which seems to be common with Catholics, that they don't even know what their own leaders have said about things like evolution and the big bang.	1329229931
The alternative power companies are not "set". They require massive subsidies to operate, without AGW those subsidies would have no basis.\n\nIf Al Gore could do something else, he would. Climate Change is a big money maker for him.\n\nFirst  you say there are more people trying to disprove AGW than there are trying to prove it, but then in the next sentence you say there is a scientific consensus that it is real. Both of those things cannot be true. Where are the numbers we can look at? I know how big the IPCC is (multi-million dollar pro-AGW), and how big some of the thinks tanks that deny AGW are. They are about the same size.\n\nI am not surprised that dissent is supported by oil companies, nor am I surprised that the people that believe in AGW have vested interests in their side winning as well. Entire organizations would disappear if AGW did not "exist".\n\nI am still on the fence, just watching how both sides react to each other. Neither side deserves much respect on this one.	1331485260

There is no such thing as a generalized black race.  Thats what you're missing.  Think of a haitian, or an egytptian, or someone from madagascar.  A south african.  A jamaican.  Distinct, isolated, populations.  These are isolated populations, the only factor they share is a skin pigment; and yet we group them into a single category.  \n\nThe studies you provided didn't show much of anything.  Their genetic material was either unavailable or provided through a different source, they failed to compensate for socio-economic factors; their entire hypothesis is an interpretation of raw data, interpreted by an Engineer no less.  \n\n	1345208362

&gt;aw fuck I typed out a long ass reponse and it was lost.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that. (Also, I just did the exact same thing &gt;_&lt;)\n\n&gt;Short story is that I used to love /r/skeptic when it has orignial research and intersting articles. This post is neither.\n\nYou're making the unfounded assumption it's supposed to be either. It's a _comic_. Aren't skeptics allowed to laugh unless they first present the sources behind the claim of the mechanism of human laughter?\n\n&gt;Furthermore in response to your comment I believe that the person making claims must provide the evidence [...]\n\nThat's fine, if a specific claim is actually being made. It's a _comic_. Lighten up, chill out, relax. Not everything has to be deadly serious in /r/skeptic.\n\n&gt;[...] but thanks for the ad homin.\n\nIt's _ad hominem_, and it wasn't. My question was quite relevant considering _your_ baseless, unverified and un-sourced claim that it was just "meaningless propaganda". I repeat, _it's a comic_.	1296547468
If you think probes and alien spacecraft are visiting Earth - explain how no telescopes have picked them up???  If we were being visited by probes and UFO's, all sorts of telescopes would be seeing stars moving around the skies in odd trajectories and at seemingly impossible speeds...\n\nBut, that's never happened.  Yet, we do full sky observations all the time...\n\n&gt; im just going to go ahead and ignore how you assigned alien lifeforms human life spans (roughly 60 years).\n\nAnd, you aren't even understanding my point...  I mentioned roughly 60 years, not because that's a human life span (human life spans are ~80 years), but because that's how long we've been sending signals into space.	1348383508

&gt;The second assumption is that ice albedo and water vapor are the only climate feedbacks, ignoring the fact that warmer oceans are likely to outgas more CO2, and that melting permafrost is likely to release large quantities of CH4.\n\nSince the oceans are a net sink of CO2, I think you mean that they will absorb less, not outgas more, right?  I don't disagree that melting permafrost will release CH4. Should temperatures get high enough, this would certainly occur.\n\nSpeaking of high temperatures, if we assume that ECS is 3X, and we assume that an increase of temps of 1 degree due to CO2 will cause these effects, I assume that you feel all of that CH4 from the permafrost melted 120K years ago during the higher temps of the last climactic optimum?  I guess it was only captured again with the onset of the ice?  I'm unclear of the science there.  I didn't know all of the permafrost is less than 120K year old.	1356202008

one main issue, i would tell you to look at all the arguments against me right now. most of them involve floors falling and causing a continuous growing mass of floors that "snowballs" or pancakes all the way down.\n\nbesides the fact that NIST/FEMA the official investigations, dont support the pancake theory, all these peoples arguments fail to realize there are VERTICAL columns that would go un-effected by the collapsing floors. \n\nthe main reason NIST/FEMA don't support the pancaking theory is this reason... the inner core columns would have still been standing hundreds of feet in the air. the building was designed to have slabs/floors hanging on the innter core columns, and outer smaller columns acting like a "screen door" mesh all the way around the perimeter. the progressive collapse of floor slabs can not account for the destruction of the large inner core columns. \n\nbut everyone continues to ignore these flaws, and continue to push their pancake theory. and any comment ive made that goes against it, even if it was a fact such as NIST's standing on that theory, i get downvoted because it threatens them. 	1332524363

UFOs have a reputation for being very difficult to study due to their unpredictability and transience.  So it's amazing to see something like this: real observations, real measurements being taken by proper scientific investigation.  \n\nI really don't know what to make of this.  Nothing has been proved conclusively, and these investigations raise a lot more questions than they answer.  And that's a good thing, really; it means there's more to this than meets even the most skeptical eye.  Even if it turns out to be a really unusual earthly phenomenon, that'll still be damn interesting. \n\nI really hope this phenomenon continues to be studied.	1339654810

James Randi exposed something similar to this that televangelists were doing in the 80's.  He dressed as an old woman and went to a televangelist for a faith healing.

Exactly.  The 50% would necessarily be simplistic because sexuality, like gender, isn't strictly binary.  And it is difficult to code for that in a meaningful way for studies, and so numbers like this always have to be taken as interesting but simplified and rarely definitive.\n\nHowever, assuming that these numbers are accurate, and assuming that the same metric was used for M-to-F and F-to-M individuals, it is interesting to consider why there could be a significant difference how the two groups identify their sexual preference.	1323382945

Yeah, it's called a fasces. It's NOT the symbol for Fascism. It was first used during the Roman Empire as a symbol of Rome of and the power it held over its own destiny and, ultimately, over life and death. \n\n[edit]Clarification: Yes, it IS the symbol for fascism, but only in that the Italian fascist movement co-opted it for its own purposes, not because it was originally designed that way. It's not like congress looked at the fasces and thought 'hey. totalitarianism. that's pretty cool. let's put it on our buidlings.'\n\nTo think so is another example of people not understanding what a symbol is. A fasces carried meaning long before the idea of fascism, and is currently used in seats of authority because it represents... you guessed it. Authority.\n\nI watched excerpts of his video, but his arguments suffer from the same problem. They are UNFALSIFIABLE, and contain an INTERNAL LOGICAL CONSISTENCY. What he spouts is conjencture, tangentially related to the evidence he purports to have, based on faulty reasoning and a poor grasp of symbolism, architecture, and human nature.\n\ni.e. Jordan Maxwell is just another von Daniken, just another David Icke, just another George Noory.	1316214613

I'm surprised that no one seems to have yet mentioned a basic understanding of [bias](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/10/17/0956797611417632.abstract), [self-deception](http://www.skepdic.com/selfdeception.html), and [magic](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/opinion-randi-magic-scientists/) — which don't just reduce to statistics and psychology, but involve a subtle, alert way of thinking that doesn't come naturally. A familiarity with the most common ways we trick ourselves or are tricked by others into believing things that are clearly false is both instructive (for a burgeoning skeptic) and illustrative (for discussing more complicated topics). We can't shed or suppress our bias, but we can account and correct for it; that's arguably most (or all) of what skepticism is about.	1336963922

&gt; In other words, no matter what you find or how you do it, the Skinwalker Ranch *will never be anything* except where scientists go to to end their careers. \n\nTo whom? \n\nAgain, there is so much focus upon disbelievers. I agree that it is frustrating and pathetic. Let them disbelieve; who cares? Look at the subject of global warming: 99% of all climate scientists agree that there is a solid factual basis to that phenomenon because there is ample scientific data that backs it, and yet millions of (uneducated and unqualified) people still disbelieve it and actively influence others towards disbelieving it. That certainly doesn't make it any less real. You can lead a horse to water, etcetera.\n\nThe important thing is to continue to gather evidence and approach each new case objectively regardless of what some people choose to believe. If we get all bunched up about the disbelievers we will lose focus. Maybe one day the data will be appreciated by society. Maybe not.\n\nAny links to the 'their careers are now over' part of the skinwalker ranch story? I'd like to read more on that. They tried to run Mack out of town, too. The mainstream scientific community is definitely hostile to any interest in the subject. For that matter, the vast majority of redditors thinks we are ALL full of shit for seriously considering this stuff.	1353193916

The key is to consider the validity of the experience without jumping to conclusions about the cause. Even in the event of suspicion of something "paranormal" there is the possibility of an explanation impossible to explain given current scientific knowledge. Too many "skeptics" can be too dismissive of the experience itself, preventing any further understanding of the cause of it. \n\ntldr; I am an agnostic with beliefs leaning toward Athiest, however I am very open to the idea of a larger "universal" picture too complex for us to explain or possibly even comprehend in our currently evolutionary state. 	1350917648

Cannabis does not contain any nicotine, nor any of the additives that tobacco companies add to make cigarettes, so that's a plus, but apart from that many of the carcinogens present in tobacco smoke are also present in marijuana smoke. To be fair, it is rare that cannabis users smoke as many joints as a tobacco users smokes cigarettes in a day.\n\nPersonally, I'm wary about *any* kind of smoke entering my lungs. Also, smoking cannabis *does* irritate the throat and causes one to cough out that ugly grey-brown phlegm. Inhaling from a vaporizer doesn't cause this. I say, why take chances?

Paranormal Activity 2 was essentially the setup for Paranormal Activity 4.  \n\nIt explained why the "wrong" sister was being tormented in Paranormal Activity (although they were both married to the demon as we learn in Paranormal Activity 3) and showed that the demon got what it wanted in the end, thus allowing Paranormal Activity 4 to occur with a possessed Katie and what I can assume is the male child.  Paranormal Activity 4 is the true sequel, while PA3 fills out the backstory.\n\nAfter watching the trailer I kind of feel like we could have done without this movie and been left to wonder whatever happened to Katie and the kid, but they did such a good job of building up the story with the third movie that I'm legitimately curious to know what's going to happen now that the demon finally has the long-awaited son in their family lineage. \n\nI saw the first Paranormal Activity in theatres and didn't really enjoy it because it was *uncomfortably* loud when big things happen.  I re-watched it and the other two at home and enjoyed it much more. 	1343878103

&gt;  I buy organic stuff when I can, but mostly because of the environmental/sustainability stuff.\n\nI have a friend who is a farmer and was looking into growing organic potatoes. He did the calculations and knew how much more he'd have to charge to make money because on average one gets about half as many potatoes per acre growing organically than non-organically.\n\nSo the world would need twice as many forests/rainforests plowed into fields if everyone were to switch to eating organic food. I'm not sure where that ranks in terms of "environmental/sustainability stuff", but I think it's pretty bad for both.\n	1347080366

Folks who hate the idea of women controlling their reproductive abilities have been beating this drum for a while.  Just a quick reading of "Are Oral Contraceptives a Significant Contributor to the Estrogenicity of Drinking Water?" from Environ. Sci. Technol., 2011, 45 (1) indicates that less that 1% of the estrogen in the water supply comes from the pill.  The majority of human-based estrogen originates from pregnant women.  The amount that comes from the pill is also less than the amount that comes from our diets (soy and dairy).  Both of these are significantly lower than the amount of estrogen contributed by livestock (who excrete a crapload more than we do).\n\nSo, if the concern is truly about estrogen in the drinking water supply, it seems that we should be tackling farming and pregnant women first.	1337455409

I have no trouble believing that people express themselves through their handwriting, and that there may be general principles involved in how people do it.  I find it more plausible than, say, palmistry, that there might actually be something there to study.\n\nHowever, what I've seen of graphology (not much admittedly) is just a bunch of hand-waving and speculative intuition.  I've never seen anyone make a rigorous study of it.  I think, at the current time, it's nowhere near being a real science.	1288956354
&gt;Well, then congratulations. Go ahead and ignore a very relevant piece of work that covers pretty much exactly the same stuff we're talking about here, namely Descartes' epistemology.\n\nThat's not relevant at all. It's actually a formal logical fallacy called ad hominem tu quoque. Arguments stand on their own. Your argument is that X is wrong because Descartes made Y argument in another work. You can't even touch X (because you don't even know what it is).\n\n&gt;If you want to make the claim that Descartes is someone we should look to for advice on how to treat things skeptically, you cannot ignore other things he has written which contradict that.\n\nI never said that Descartes is someone you should look to for advice on how to treat things skeptically.\n\nI said The Method, which you haven't read, was a good place to start being skeptical about your own ideas. Now you're lying.\n\n&gt;Um, your claim that Empricisim is radically different from science and the modern skeptical movement?\n\nThat never happened.\n\n&gt;And please explain to me how "create" and "produce" mean significantly different things.\n\nCreate has the pejorative connotation of Creationism in an argument about how the Universe came about.\n\n&gt; that the existence of the universe implies that something else existed beforehand - and pointing out the similarity between that and the creationist cosmological argument.\n\nThank you for admitting that you committed a guilt by association fallacy.\n\n&gt;Assuming that there must be something else that "produced" this universe leads to exactly the same problem with the idea that the universe must have been created by something, and it deserves just as much respect (read: very little).\n\nAnd yet you can't even contradict it.\n\n&gt;Pretty sure I'm done with this conversation.\n\nYou don't even know what it's about. You haven't even read the fucking book.

With all that "information" about the danger of flu shots that is out there, the idea that getting one could trigger a reaction from someone who already sufferd from psychological illnesses but had shown no major symptoms before isn't too far fetched, and if some irresponsible doctors then start to give the idea of being physically ill credibility, this could very well happen - this could also explain why symptoms occur when she is made aware of the fact that she is supposed to be ill.\n \nThis, or she could have made the whole thing up for whatever reason, the point is: We don't know.	1323353420
Hi, Siarp, I'm a skeptic too.  I posted to /r/paranormal because when I returned home from Europe and showed the photo to everyone no one could identify what the "face like image" was, but thats the first thing everyone who looked at the photo saw.  \n\nIt was an iphone 4, and yes, it has a flash.  The church I was in was an 11th century church and the first thing posted on the door to the said church was NO FLASH WITH CAMERA.  \n\nIt was my first time being in Berlin, and my first time being in a church so old, so I took pictures.  Everywhere.  I figured if I took enough pictures a few would turn out okay and I could show people my amazing photography skills.\n\nAt the end of the trip I deleted probably 25 crummy shots of that church alone, and hundreds more of the trip that weren't focused or were to dark or blurry or whatever.\n\nWhen I posted to /r/paranormal I didn't say in my post "Hey, guys look at this ghost!" I was looking for a fun answer to a interesting photo.	1350393797

It's a private event, they can ultimately do what they want. I don't agree with the intimidation, nor with the alleged threats, but how they were treated isn't that surprising given the incompatibility in perspectives.  \n\nFrom the perspective of the event organizers, they do not want people there who aren't potential consumers. Or, worse yet, have an adverse effect on those there to consume. Try questioning wal-mart employees on behalf of a group bent on exposing the evils of capitalism, consumerism, and the plight of third world labourers and see how far you get.\n\nI realize that the vast majority of products on offer at events like these are useless beyond placebo, but that really isn't the point. Yes, It's about profits and intimidating those who get in the way of making money. But go into any sort of organization as a known antagonist to that group's stated ideas and goals and see how you're treated. \n\nedit: Spelling	1291082956

I understand the concept just fine, and what is being discussed has absolutely nothing to do with the burden of proof. \n\nThe positive claim was made/implied by the article: "The supernatural doesn't exist because there is no scientific evidence to support it". I rebut the claim by pointing out that such an argument is clearly circular; that is, if you use a naturalistic method (that automatically ignores and rejects all supernatural claims) to study the world, then you're going to get naturalistic conclusions, regardless of whether the supernatural claims are true or not. This is akin to instructing people to go out and only count red flowers, and when they return with their data, you conclude that yellow, blue, and white flowers don't exist because you only have evidence for red flowers. Again, most simply, if your method and approach explicitly tells you to ignore an entire category, then you can't use that data to say the ignored category doesn't exist. \n\nI have not claimed that the supernatural is real (and I personally don't think the concept is even coherent enough to be worthy of consideration), and I haven't claimed that the concept should be treated as real unless disproved. My only point is that science is a tool for studying the natural world. Anyone who thinks that the conclusions from science can have *anything at all* to say on claims of the supernatural simply does not understand science. \n\nThis is basic high school science stuff. 	1343020519

&gt;Well, I'm perfectly willing to cede to the notion that you might be better read on the subject than I.\n\nI'm probably not.\n\n&gt;But in all honesty I have not seen much anarchist philosophy that just stopped at being antistate. It was always entirely anti-hierarchy.\n\nAnti-hierarchy anarchists are much more numerous than anarcho-capitalists.  Anarcho-capitalism is not a very widely known school of thought.  So, it's completely reasonable you've never encountered it.\n\n&gt;As far as I can tell anarcho-capitalism is the only anarchist philosophy that is not anti-hierarchy\n\nThere are some voluntaryists who do not identify as anarcho-capitalists.  Some individualist-anarchist-ish people might not fully qualify as anti-hierarchy anarchists.  But anarcho-capitalism does seem to be pretty prominent in the not-anti-hierarchy anarchism world.\n\n&gt;Is there much writing by anarchists (Rothbard and his adherents aside) that backs up the notion that it can mean only antistate?\n\nI would say that there's lots of anarcho-capitalist writers who use anarchist in the anti-state way, but I would be surprised if many of them claimed that was the only valid definition.  Anarcho-capitalists can't ignore the history and large numbers of people who use anarchism in the anti-hierarchy way.  At worst, they'll say that the anti-hierarchy anarchists want to establish something that's pretty much a state, and therefore aren't anarchists.  I usually argue against them on that point...\n\n&gt;And yes, you are correct that there are multiple usages of words. But that doesn't necessarily mean that these words are being used correctly.\n\nWell, words are just sounds and letters that have common agreements about associated ideas.  So, I'm pretty accepting when there is widespread "incorrect" use.  I actually wish that "anarchism" *only* meant anti-hierarchy and that the anarcho-capitalist types had never been labeled as anarchist.  My theory is that they mostly got that label from other people that didn't really know much about the history of anarchism.  So, "anarchism" gained a new definition mostly through ignorance.  Oh well.\n\nI think that anti-hierarchists have a stronger claim on the term, but I also accept the consequences of language being decided by popular usage.  So, to deal with the ambiguity and to ward off miscommunication, I usually over-specify what I'm talking about.  I *wish* I could give you the word.\n\nAre you an anti-hierarchist?  This converation has gone so much better than the last time I talked about this when an anti-hierarchist.	1306258509

But even in the US, where we have widespread and free access to condoms, our rates of HIV transmission are quickly growing in certain demographics. \n\nCondoms alone are not enough to stop the spread of HIV, because they aren't used consistently. 	1346089038

Economics is tricky, because of the nature of history. The evidence is not straightforward, because there are hundreds of interacting variables. Post hoc is rampant. I think that's why it's best to say that we just don't know that much about it. Human society is a highly complex, perhaps a chaotic system.\n\nThat said, I think economics does have some valuable insights to offer. It's just that I don't think there's such a thing as a completely objective source of info, because of its nature.	1282957128

Interesting article, but I believe this "Perception Gap" is part of a mathematical phenomena that people can learn to avoid, it is not necessarily constrained by instincts. Here is why:\n\n1. Input (how do you believe the world is right now)\n2. Function (how do you believe the world works right now)\n3. Output (how do you think the world will be in the future)\n\nAnybody can be right or wrong about the 3 different layers, but if they are not right about all 3 of them simultaneously, then they are also wrong, even they might not discover it. People usually check 1 and 3 and correct 2 only when necessary and this results in situations like believing they know better how gravity works than Einstein because they can fix a car, or believing they win a dice game because they thought it was their lucky day, or believing a politician will hold his promise because he just said something they wanted to hear. This structure also holds for *similar* and *different* by comparing two objects.\n\nWhen two people talk, they use either abstract terms or examples to produce a picture of an analogy which for the 3 layer structure holds different characteristics. This is why analogies work for a particular situation, and why though experiments can be used to solve problems. For example: When two cars start from *different* locations (1) and drives in *same* directions (2) on a flat surface, they will end up in *different* locations (3). This also fits an analogy of parallel lines. This is a simplification that does not require direct observation or discrete values, only knowing whether something is similar or different.\n\nThe biggest problem is when people expect yes/no. For any story that builds up it's arguments to a conclusion there is no simple answer. You need to comprehend not just the conclusion, but the picture which the other person is trying to tell, before you really understand it is and learned something.\n\nOne can investigate perception and so on, but many problems only require the ability to think. If people give themselves enough time to think something through, they usually figure it out. The problem is that we live in a society where everything is meant to go fast, and people have no more time than hearing a "yes" or "no".	1328712744

Just want to say... I work at Walgreens, and this really isn't a matter of a store's individual discretion. Reset planograms are frequently sent down from corporate, so the most recent cough/cold reset must have put all the homeopathic "medicine" together in that region's stores. A store manager has some degree of freedom in merchandising, but they can't just entirely shift up an aisle like that without drastically increasing workload, and at this point in the year, no store manager would risk such a time-wasting project or they could get fired.\n\nThe real things to worry about with people accidentally buying homeopathic remedies are the Hyland's pain relief products. There aren't any actual medicines specifically for joint cramps, so Hyland's holds a monopoly on it, which means that they get a lot of business from desperate senior citizens.\n\nFortunately I can sometimes prevent people from buying this crap...	1352739851
Let me explain how the simulation works. You give it the building schematics: what it's made of, how it's put together, physical properties, etc.\n\nThen, you tell it where the fires are and their composition. What they are made of, how they burn, the temperature, etc.\n\nThen you tell it to run. Then you wait a really long time because good simulation takes a fuckload of time. That video isn't a realtime run of the simulation. It's a compilation of all of the renders done.\n\nNote what we didn't specify: where it fails. Where it fails is determined by something we call math. You see, we can use math in conjunction with the physical and chemical properties of objects to approximate what would happen in certain situations.\n\nSo, in the simulation video, the fact that the floor failed in two places at nearly the same time is insignificant because it was determined mathematically based on the information fed into the simulation. If they would run the simulation again, they could get a similar but slightly different result. Because while specific events are essentially random, they are random within a certain range.\n\nThat building could have conceivably fallen in one of several million ways. The fact that it happened the way it did is no more significant than if it had fallen at a tilt. Which is why when a building is likely to fall, you get the fuck away from that shit regardless of where you happen to be standing. Because you can't say with 100% certainty what will and will not happen.\n\nWhich is what you are doing. You are trying to tell us that with 100% certainty the building could not have fallen like that because of the fire.	1315573219

Isn't there a difference between having no respect for a person as opposed to having no respect for a thing they believe in? Friends of mine are reasonably devout Christians, and while I have no respect whatsoever for religions or religious beliefs, I have the utmost respect for my friends as people. They can believe whatever they want, and they never try to force it on me or anyone else, so they can worship whatever and whoever they please as far as I'm concerned. Same goes for my father (with slightly less 'never tries to force it on anyone'). Let him believe what he likes; he's still my father and I love and respect him as a person. Who happens to believe in some stuff that I am very much opposed to. But it's the *belief* that I disrespect, not the *person*.\n\nI might as well lose respect for a person because they liked Oasis, or the Black Eyed Peas, for all the sense that makes.	1301430248

It does exist, although different people call it different things. It's more common with those who use drugs and alcohol, but even a "straight" person with a temper can experience it. When I was younger (and arguably slightly more short-fused) I have experienced it on a number of occasions. Needless to say it's not a great experience.\n\nI'm no doctor, but from what I understand the most likely causes are stress, and the sudden build up of high blood pressure that accompanies an outburst. In a stressful situation, the body releases cortisol as a response mechanism. Too much cortisol can prevent the brain from laying down a new memory, or from accessing already existing memories. Temporary memory loss in these type of situations can vary from being "fuzzy" to full blackout.\n\nI can't explain it very well, but if you would like to learn more [this](http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/stress.html) may help.\n\n(edit- typo	1350437001

Here's a brief off the top of my head overview of some of the main ones:\n\nSelective breeding - selecting for a particular trait.\n\nHybridization - crossing two lines to get a hybrid plant.\n\nWide crossing - hybridizing one thing with something very distantly related, like crossing an apple with a wild Malus species, or crossing a cultivated potato with a wild potato.\n\nEmbryo rescue - Taking an embryo from a cross that would otherwise abort the embryo and culturing it, allowing you to make crosses that would otherwise result in non-viable seed.\n\nMutagenesis - using something, like a mutagenic chemical or ionizing radiation, to induce mutations in cells.\n\nSport selection - used in a lot of fruit trees.  sometimes a bud will mutate and produce a branch that has a different quality than the rest of the tree.  This branch is then propagated.  A lot of the apples in stores today are sports of the original variety but are not named as such (the last Red Delicious you ate was probably a sport of the original Red Delicious).\n\nSomaclonal variation - when plant cells are being tissue cultured and a mutation arises in the culture, then this mutation is selected.\n\nPolyploidy - when the amount of chromosomes in the plant is altered.  For example, some apples are triploid, having three chromosome sets instead of the usual two in diploid apples.  Seedless watermelons are also triploid.  Potatoes are tetraploid, wheat is hexaploid, and strawberries are octaploid.  This can be induced with colchicine (as it is with watermelons) or can be a result of hybridization (as it is in wheat).\n\nProtoplast fusion - when you take two cells, lyse off the cell wall, put them next to each other and zap them so they fuse.  I don't think this is commonly used yet though.\n\nSo there's quite a number of ways we modify plants besides genetic engineering (even GE has multiple types: transgenic, cisgenic, and antisense).  Can't think of any more right now, but there's probably other techniques used.  Ironically GE is fairly predictable by comparison to some of these yet I doubt most people protesting GE have ever even heard of them.  Also, not genetic modifications, also worth mention is that some of plants are commercially produced by tissue culture, taking a piece of plant and growing it in vitro using hormones to regrow a new plant from a leaf or something, and lots of tree fruit are grafted, when they take a piece of one plant and graft it to another to produce a genetically identical tree and to take advantage of good rootstocks.	1331353160

how would it work in this application or in general? \n\nhow do you reduce your electric bill with geothermal? \n\nidk how they do it on an already built house but if one is building a house to include geothermal they run pipes through the floor then down deep underground where it's a steady temperature. keeping the basement floor at about the same temp as it is underground. \n\nDepending on where you are it's 50 degrees or so. So you've got a floor radiating 50 degrees so your furnace runs less. and cooling the house in the summer thus running the AC less. Saving electricity. \n\nIn the Sterling Engine case you've got water warmer than tap water so you have to warm it less to make the engine run. \n\nI'm probably wrong though. 	1344738459

This book was where Dr. Mack started to veer more into the 'spiritual aspects of the abduction phenomenon and what it might ultimately mean for humanity. Interesting, but not sure I go along with some of his conclusions. \n\nThis came after his book 'Abduction', which was more centered upon his research on over 300 subjects and their experiences. He initially thought that these cases would be easy to define as abnormal psychological manifestations, but he instead became convinced that these were more likely real physical events after his first few cases.\n\nHe then devoted his career to further investigation. Harvard tried to throw him out for it, but his work was pretty solid for the most part. Pretty sobering stuff.	1354762700
&gt;Brewing has always been an interest of mine, but the science seems somewhat daunting.\n\nIt can be if you don't take it one step at a time.  Too sum it up briefly, it's just yeast eating sugar and oxygen to create alcohol and carbon dioxide.  The complexity comes from sanitation (HUGE PART) and ingredients.  Most people start out with extract (suppliers basically malt barley for you, this gets complicated so just suffice it for now to say you use extract).  You start with about 2 gallons of water, bring it to about 150F.  Add some speciality grains, steep like a tea for 30 mins.  Bring to a boil, add your extract and hops and boil for an hour.  Then you cool it to about 70-80F (I put my kettle in my bathtub that I plug, fill with cold water and 3 - 7lb bags of ice, and add in 3 gallons of cooled water I have in the fridge. ) and pitch your yeast and let it sit for about 2-3 weeks.  \n\n\nThe big part about sanitation, is you have to make sure it's clean of material and then everything after the boil (the boil will kill anything that could infect the beer) needs to be sanitized so you don't introduce any foreign material or bacteria.  \n\nYou can look [here](http://www.howtobrew.com/intro.html) for additional information on the process.\nIf you are interested in ever getting into it let me know, or check out /r/homebrewing.  I'd be more than willing to answer any questions you may have.\n\nA starter kit will pretty much run you between 100-150 plus a kettle and plus your brewing ingredients.  	1286950197
My grandfather killed himself in June of 2008 my brother and I found him. That night laying in my bed unable to sleep I drifted into the weird awake/sleep state and got lost in my mind. I was started when I came back to reality and saw what looked like my grandfather but younger standing at the foot of my bed. I just laid there scared and unsure how I should deal with this and he smiled slightly and nodded, he was gone. A few nights later he came to me in a dream and told me how sorry he was for hurting me the way he did and that he loved me. I still have vivid dreams about him once in a while and when I wake up I'm usually crying because I miss him so much.\n\nAnother time one of my friends girl friend died. I had met her maybe a month before her death and we clicked as much as you can when you meet someone for an hour. The day after she passed I had a dream about her, we were playing a board game and just chatting she told me to tell Travis that she was sorry but so happy to not be in pain. She said that she loves him and wants him to be happy. I told him about this the next day and was shocked that he had a similar dream. 	1349113684

My ex used to get attacked by (what we believe) to be a demon a long time ago, and all I can tell you is if it happens to be one, if it isn't medical in any way, or anything spiritual that is manifesting, you need to take it seriously. Scratches and bruises are one thing but this CAN get worse into worse physical abuse. Does she see things during the day? i.e. shadows, really bad, realistic nightmares, etc. Does this happen majorly when she's stressed or has a bad day? \n\nBeing a non-religious person myself, the only remedies I ever hear about regarding these types of attacks IS religion, so my first option would be going to a priest and seeing what you can do. Blessing each room in the house, blessing her. As for the name on her stomach, could it possibly be the spirit's name? Whatever it is, it is far stronger than your average ghost. Keep doing the extra precautions like burning candles and the salt if it's helping. \n\nIn the face of this, she needs to be brave because these types of things feed off of negativity. The stronger it gets, the more potential it has to severely harm her, even moreso than what's occurring. \n\nAs someone has said, make sure she goes with a God she believes in. It's all a battle with her mind and inner strength, and I wish you the best of luck; keep safe.	1351092592

Well, I don't really have experience in Astral Projection, outside of a few books and biographies that I read many years ago. I actually do believe it's a possibility, though I think some of the things associated with it are not accurate. A book I read once many years ago said something about being tied to your physical body by some thread-like thing, and if you stray too far and the thread breaks, you will never make it back to your physical body. I also read that it leaves you open to demonic possession. I don't believe either of those things.

Yeah, I guess fiasco is a little strong.  There was a panel discussion that was completely pointless.  Then both Grothe's and Randi's presentations beat the topic into the ground, and other people on the panel also had to talk about it during their talks.  \n\nI guess my frustration extends from first my local skeptic group which I had to stop going to due to this type of crap, then I had gone to Skepticon without knowing about the drama with Randi's organization ahead of time and was very confused.  \n\nWith TAM starting next week, I don't want it to turn into a sexism thing.  The theme this year is Space.  That's what I want - not a 'you're a paternalistic chauvinist who doesn't like the success of woman.'

You are correct, but the cycle works in the following way: The bank can make loans of $9 of that $10. Suppose they loan it to housebuyer bill, who buys a house with that $9 to houseowner sally, well sally will take that $9 and put it into her bank and her bank then goes and makes loans of $8 from that $9. This cycle continues until a monetary injection of $X has expanded to (1/r)*X where r is the fraction of reserves held by the bank. 	1312521460

Great captures! EVPs continue to amaze me while the rest of the stuff people capture become less so. \n\nWhen you post, don't put what you think it's saying. Once you tell people what to listen for, people will hear exactly that.  Have them PM you their interpretations. You'll get a better idea if most people are hearing what you are hearing. Just a tip, nothing more. :)\n\nI am sure that some of the stuff people capture are random noises mistaken for voices maybe even cell phones, radio, natural explanations, etc. But other times it is quite unmistakable. It's a voice, much like your 'Run away' one. Those just blow my mind. I still don't fully believe that they are from people who have died. To accept that claim, requires a whole lot of extraordinary evidence to back it up.\n\nThis is great book about EVPs: [EVP and New Dimensions](http://www.amazon.com/EVP-New-Dimensions-Alexander-MacRae/dp/1411615034/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341927381&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=EVP+new+dimensions) by Alexander MacRae. \n\nKeep recording and posting!	1341927456

I have personally never seen these supposed "Skeptic community... issues with women", and I'm not entirely convinced that it exists. Most skeptics I know are also some of the most progressive people I know, and would openly shun anyone who acted misogynistic or chauvinistic around a woman. \n\nI mean, I'm sure it's *possible* that some people who have interacted with RW have said terrible things, but I find it hard to believe that these interactions are a trait or characteristic of our community as a whole. Think about it - basically every self-identified skeptic knows who RW is. She does literally hundreds of events per year, which means that she has interacted with tens of thousands of people in the past "several" years that she references. It is entirely UNSURPRISING that she has met a few unsavory characters in that bunch - but is it a regular occurrence? I doubt it. \n\nTry to believe me when I say that I'm basing the following statement on RWs personality (or at least, the personality I have inferred from SGU and other public appearances), and not the fact that she is a woman whom I do not find attractive... But I think she's making a lot of this stuff up. (I'm not saying she's lying about everything - like I said, it wouldn't surprise me if *some* people really did say *some* of those things.) \n\nShe tries to convey a certain character in SGU that she clearly IS NOT in real life. Its like comparing the movie character "Juno" to the real-life Ellen Page - Juno is fun to watch and be entertained by, but is unrealistic as an actual human being. So these lame, highly publicized "fights" that RW gets herself into just seem to be childish attempts to prove to the world that she *really is* this super sexy, independent, snarky person that she portrays on SGU - that she really is Juno, and not real-life human Ellen Page.\n\nIronically, this character makes her less relatable to the rest of us... She's trying to hide her own insecurities (which we can relate to) behind a faux veneer of victimization, and it's pathetic. 	1338574972

I see a lot of 'might' before the potential problems/dangers with no actual proof.  So we have an absence of evidence against spinal manipulation, correct?\n\nAlso your 1st link states " An adolescent child might benefit from appropriate manipulation designed to relieve symptoms caused by uncomplicated, mechanical-type back problems."  Which is what I and other evidence based chiropractors treat.  We do not treat the non existent 'subluxation'.\n\nI will disagree with link #2's statement of "Chiropractic is defined by a belief in vertebral subluxations."  This statement is false, as this is an opinion piece.\n\nOverall the research is not complete for pediatric manipulation but then again there is no research to reveal the amount of risk, the types of risk, ways to screen for red or yellow flags.  Until the research is done on both sides it is an incomplete argument for both parties.	1342747661

Science is not a religion. It is verified, replicated, based on empirical evidence, objective, and viewed with appropriate skepticism way before it makes it out to the public. I trust science because it has checks and balances. Common sense does not.\n\nI'm sure you think you know that it works, and you're right. It does work. But not for any of the reasons that chiropractors say, and not for any of the serious ailments they claim to treat. Any effect that you are seeing is either something that could have been done by a physical therapist, or placebo. There is no evidence supporting "vertebral subluxation". \n\nAnecdotes are certainly not the only evidence you need. How could any real knowledge work this way? You say I rely too much on science so instead you place all your trust on the common sense of your friends and family? Do they study this sort of thing? Are they objective? Do they have any medical degrees? If I should not put trust in science, with all of its controls and experimentation, you should absolutely not put your trust in friends and family who know nothing about it other than effects that can be explained by placebo.	1315679873

I seem to remember that mumps can have some pretty bad side effects. Let me google that for a moment. Oh yes...\n\n-------------------\n**Prognosis for Adult Mumps**\n\nMost adults recover from mumps without any long-term problems. However, there are a number of complications of mumps seen in adults. Some of these complications can occur with mumps symptoms. In other cases, these complications may develop without symptoms. *In rare cases, long-term problems can result, including deafness.*\n \n\nComplications associated with adults mumps include:\n \n* Inflammation of the testes, called orchitis (this occurs in 1 out of 4 males with mumps)\n* Inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (called encephalitis and meningitis, respectively)\n* Inflammation of the ovaries and/or breasts (oophoritis and mastitis, respectively)\n* Spontaneous abortion, particularly in early pregnancy (miscarriage)\n* Deafness, usually permanent\n* Pancreatitis.\n\n-------------------\nHope your friend isn't pregnant or too fond of music then.	1272053696
Well, that's really a lie...  I have Celiac's and there's gluten in all sorts of distilled beverages... \n\nFrom Celiac.com:\n\n&gt; They did find gluten in distilled liquor! The levels varied from zero to 200-mg gluten/liter. The highest amount was found in a "Creme de Framboise" (200 mg/liter) but second was a French brandy VSOP with a score of 180 m g/liter. A Dutch gin was negative, which might be an indication that gluten in these type of liquor is not a carry over to the distillate! My guess is that this gluten is derived from the caramel coloring, though there is no proof about this yet. I always advise sensitive patients to abstain from brown colored liquor!\n\nEDIT:  Interesting that I'm getting downvoted so much - considering that the OP said 'no distilled spirits contain gluten' and I posted a quote (from a reliable source) proving the opposite...	1336937762

&gt;there are limitations to science\n\nNone of which are surpassed by metaphysical claims. Isn't that interesting?\n\nYour first comment said "really, zero anecdotes about people meeting or experiencing God? Sorry, this is patently false." \n\nFor you to accurately say "patently false" you need to demonstrate that people have met or experienced god. And you already know that means believing someone who's met Vishnu AND someone who's met Christ at the same time, or discrediting BOTH of those individuals. Or, even worse, you can arbitrarily chose one and discredit the other. The problem with keeping an open mind is that your brain falls out and you become a Zoroastrian Catholic Mormon Hindu because if you're treating all claims equally you cannot discredit any of them.\n\nBesides, "seeing Jesus" when they're in a state of delirium is not anecdotal evidence. Its a state of delusion. 	1322700675

As a kid I remain pretty grateful to resources that taught me responsible skepticism, from Zillions (a Consumer Reports-printed mag that dissected advertising methods) and even stuff like Disney's Recess (which celebrated individuality and showed that even adults could be misinformed or silly in their thinking).\n\nUnfortunately, I can't fulfill your specific request (which seems to be an appeal for a book going over methodology), but I do have some suggestions for books going over the mindset of skepticism and the scientific method. If your child is still pretty young, [this book](http://www.amazon.com/How-Think-Like-Scientist-Scientific/dp/0690045654/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298798836&amp;sr=8-1) is something of a classic and written for young children.\n\nI haven't actually read [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Maybe-Yes-No-Guide-Skeptics/dp/0879756071/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1298799129&amp;sr=8-1), but it looks fantastic. The first few pages available in the preview go over a child addressing rumours with other children that a local house is haunted.\n\nRegarding the methodology angle, pouring over reviews of a few "science for kids" books on Amazon couldn't be a bad start. Given that "debunking" really doesn't have any real epistemological distinction from science itself and standard empiricism I'm not sure that more is really needed :).	1298799263

&gt;What do you even mean when you say "theory supported by evidence"? As we both know, nothing can be "proven", so where do you draw the line?\n\nWow. It's as if you had no science education whatsoever.\n\nLet me put it this way: the more lines of evidence support a theory, the more likely it is to be true. The less evidence there is supporting a theory, the less likely it is to be true.\n\n&gt;As someone who aspires to be as skeptical as possible, I try avoiding any beliefs.\n\nWe're not talking about beliefs. We're talking about accepting that things are true.\n\nFor example, you probably accept that I'm a real person writing these messages to you. That is a reasonable thing to accept, as it is much likelier than other outcomes.\n\n&gt;IMHO, this way of saying "I accept the theory" is just a convenient way to avoid the word believe while implying the alleged validity of the theory.\n\nWell, it's your opinion, as you say, and I don't share it. Goodbye.	1328407432

&gt; Doctors readily admit that we have been giving away vaccinations and anti-biotics when they were not really needed.\n\nI've never heard a doctor say that vaccines were being given out too much. The dangers of antibiotics are not a problem for vaccines. Vaccines simply get your immune system to be able to resist a disease without any kind of treatment by exposing it to a dead/weakened version of a disease. \n\nThe only reason vaccines sometimes wear off is that viruses and bacteria evolve way faster than we do, so that the new strain of influenza is different enough from last year's strain (totally different strains: last years might have been H2N4, and this year's might be H3N1. Same symptoms, related viruses, but not the same virus. I might get that wrong) that the immune response is no longer effective. And for some vaccines, a shot is good enough to last a lifetime.\n\nThe FDA isn't that poorly organized, but it's not beyond lobbying. That being said, most of the lobbying goes around labeling: what is or isn't a natural ingredient, or not labeling something is a GMO. The studies they do on GMO's, MSG, or Aspartame are reliable science. They still do make sure stuff is safe before approving it. The only time they don't is when they let something rush to market, but that's normally over optimism about treating something bad like cancer, heart disease, arthritis, or obesity. \n\nFinally, studies on GMOs, aspartame, and MSG have been done by non government entities. The results aren't any different, and university research is generally pretty insulated from corporate influences, and they came to the same conclusions. I'm not too sure about MSG, but there have been dozens of studies on GMOs and Aspartame, and the only studies on either that show them being dangerous are biased and aren't peer reviewed.\n\n\nOh, one last thing: You said that you'd be alienating the other side. As someone who comes from a family that about a 3rd of which believe in Woo, being nice and understanding doesn't work. These are people who lecture me about drinking a diet coke because the aspartame "causes brain cancer/makes you fat/is bad for you somehow, but I forget exactly how." Trust me, nothing you say will point out that they don't have evidence. Period. I will never drink a Diet Coke or diet Dr. Pepper (which I drink for the flavor) in peace at a family gathering. It just won't happen.	1341942261

1. Present self as sexual object.\n2.

&gt; People still believe in the Pheonix lights despite this video showing that when the lights disappeared, they were falling behind the mountains\n\nThere have been countless people that have testified on video that what is shown on video *is not what they saw.* So, yes, they continue to believe that the event truly happened and they "know what they saw."\n\n&gt; Marfa Lights are still routinely believed, despite this item\n\nJust because one sighting/phenomenon was debunked, doesn't necessarily mean others are as well.

Thank you for relaying information given to you by a trusted first hand source. I have looked over you past posts and bullshitting people on stuff like this doesn't seem like your M.O..\n\nNo one here has knowledge of what is and isn't possible. I personally don't find it outside the realm of possibility that a B52 might be out fitted with composite wings and some sort of electromotive drive. The B52 is a very old and highly adapted airframe. One only has to look at the stealth versions of the Huey and Black Hawk to see how radically an airframe can be modified.\n\nI am not going to dismiss your story out of hand and find it interesting.

I've always wondered if it's because conspiracy theorists inherently believe in some sort of ordered universe, and don't think the universe would let these miscreants get away with it. Thus these events are arranged for them, the truth-seekers, so they can discover the evil plot and foil it before it's too late by waking the sheeple.	1344542542

My uncle was a true believer chiropractor. So true, that he refused to treat his colon cancer when it was found at stage 1 using allopathic medicine and relied solely on chiropractic treatment.

&gt;Ehh, I don't really like this. Just because someone doesn't believe in god doesn't mean they have anything to do with science. \n\nAgreed. I'm not really suggesting it as a replacement for "atheist". But in Dawkins book The God Delusion, he wasn't really promoting atheism so much as rational scientific thinking. That's what the majority of New Atheists seem to want.\n\nNot believing in god(s) is just one of the results of applying the kind of thinking that New Atheists generally want.	1279275859

there were plenty of devices patented in the 90s that use thermite at high pressure that "shoots" out of the device at high temperature and high speed. if similar devices like these were used, explode would have been a better term to use then burn because they didnt just get hot and start burning like would or some thermite just laying on a table. 	1337018385

Ok, that would be a good example, though I am certain that in a drug study it is far better randomized, and it seems very dubious to me that such approval is a good thing as the effect is not very strong and is too easily countered by perceived safety. If you assume a population that has a small percentile of extremely-at-risk individuals (who practice something particularly risky during sex), it seems to me that a short term study may yield overly optimistic results as the ultra high risk sub population would saturate in longer term.\n\nedit: also i think people don't normally just decide to blow off a lot of money on a drug, without expecting to be able to do more risky things sexually in return (given that they are already trading survival vs lifestyle).	1346095311

I don't know if this would work, but why not ask to go with her to her homeopath's appointment next time (or offer to take her to an appointment if she's just buying stuff at a health food store and dosing herself).\n\nMy experience with alternative practitioners is that many see themselves as complementary to bio-medicine, and actually encourage their patients to ALSO seek the care of a doctor.\n\nI realise this is not the case with all practitioners, so this might not work, but maybe you could interview some alternative practitioners in your area and treat your mom to several appointments with one you can trust to encourage her to take her health more seriously.\n\nGood Luck.  As a future "alternative" practitioner myself (acupuncture) it really frustrates me to hear people dismiss the benefits of "western" medicine.	1296693041

you have NO IDEA of all of the moving parts behind the scenes and the motivations of the actors - you have no way to claim the official story is nearly 100% true or 1/2 true. Just one major withheld secret could turn the whole thing on it's head. We do know that the commission was a fucking dog and pony show so it's no more informative than the conspiracy theorists really. As for other lines of inquiry (jackass), the lines are many and convoluted and would shed no real light. We need a second commission, we need to haul Cheney in with his new heart and put him under fucking oath, same goes for Saudi actors, Jeb Bush, World Trade Center insurers, Clinton, Tennent, Clarke, FBI, Pentagon, First responders, NORAD, FAA, ISI, Curveball, Bin Laden's Wife, any Arab "masterminds", Zelikow, Freeh - you get the idea. For every expert one guy can produce there is another expert who claims the opposite. Building 7 is fucked up dude. just sayin.

I do agree that it was government inaction.

The truth is all is subjective and what is real for one person doesn't have to be real for other one. We create our own personal reality using our consciousness, then we create a shared reality through sharing consciousness between different persons and finally we create an established reality (common for most/all of us) through the consciousness of all of us together. And as WE really create our own reality we can get to do amazing things in it (just being aware and totally convinced that this things are real). Which is really intriguing is that through the shared reality some people due to different reasons sometimes can influence/impose/show/share some of that things from their personal reality into others realities. It's like a clash of consciousness and the result depends on how possible is the thing you are doing, in the other person personal reality.\n\n  I hope this can be understandable someway. It's not the best explanation I have done of this, but I am not too mentally focused today.\n\nEdit: added a word.	1356284432
Almost certainly an airplane. At that distance our eyes want to see a 2D flat plane but in reality you're looking at a complex 3D curved space. It can create an illusion that something is traveling straight up when really it's traveling mostly parallel to the ground. It's possible it could be a missile, but most are going to be too small for you to see at that distance. 	1313161925

&gt; Well hopefully the teacher is familiar with the scientific method, which makes the facts that they're passing on better than the religious "facts" preachers pass on. Eventually the students must come to think and critically analyse things for themselves, but to get up to the point where you can do that you did need a good fact base first.\n\n\nYes, that's also my point: teaching just facts without teaching how do we know them is counter productive. We have to teach some introduction to logic and the scientific method as soon as we start teaching the basic facts of the universe	1314977332

According to the article, and I have no idea whether what the article is claiming is correct or not, 10,000 IU is fine.\n\n&gt;In November 2010, the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine issued its first new recommendations about the vitamin since 1997, and many people were disappointed. The institute did boost its recommended daily amounts to 400 IU for infants, 600 IU for most adults, and 800 IU for those over age seventy. It also said there was no harm in taking up to 10,000 IU daily, although it conservatively adopted 4,000 IU as the official recommended upper limit.	1311324247

I think presenting both sides of a news story is often a symptom of lazy reporting. A lot of reporters (and I'm talking about more about local TV reporters, not necessarily newspaper reporters, although many of them are guilty as well) don't have the time, motivation, or intellectual ability to dig into a story to determine which side of the story the evidence supports and tell us what actually happened.\n\nBy providing both sides, they can avoid doing to difficult leg work and claim that their reporting is balanced. 	1349789390
You're providing quotes that support my position... I'm *seriously* wondering if you've started arguing against a different point than mine.\n\nIn [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/dy9w4/agnostic_on_the_fence_i_have_a_question_for/c13ultq), you disputed my claim that saying "I believe there is no god" is strong atheism."\n\nThen you quote from the article just now to support your view:\n\n&gt;To be more precise about the issue of belief, consider the two possible claims one can make regarding the existence of a god:\n\n  &gt; 1. The god exists.\n  &gt; 2. The god does not exist. \n\n&gt; There are two positions one can take with respect to either claim:\n\n  &gt; 1. Belief or acceptance of the claim.\n  &gt; 2. Disbelief or rejection of the claim. \n\n&gt; For claim number 1 (the god exists), the theist takes the first position (belief), while the atheist takes the second (disbelief).\n\n&gt; For claim number 2 (the god does not exist), the theist takes the second position (disbelief), while the atheist can hold either position (belief or disbelief).\n\n&gt; Notice, therefore, that atheists need not positively believe that no gods exist. Some do, and this position is often known as strong atheism. \n\nThis basically says "claiming 'I believe no gods exist' is strong atheism". How does this not support what I said before?	1288396022

Also worth noting: predictive models like this require training sets (building the model) and testing sets (validating the model). If we wanted to really see if active facebook users were driving the debt crisis, we would need to see how well our model predicted future events. Since there's only one facebook and only one Greece, we'd have to wait a while and gather data. If we really wanted to see if beer predicts sexytimes, we'd just have to set aside a lot of OK Cupid users while we built our sexy beer model, then test our hypothesis on the remaining OK cupid users. Without that, we can never be sure if our model is generalizable.	1353390242
I agree with you. Little known fact: The difference between man made and UFO crop circles is in the kernels.\n\n&gt;Biological anomalies and unreproducable effects such as nodal bending (where the 'knuckles' on stems are bent at strange angles to effect certain shapes in the lay) are always absent from man-made designs.\n\nFrom http://www.swirlednews.com/crop.asp\n\n&gt;Work by laboratories on circle-affected crop has shown biological changes taking place at a cellular level, suggesting the involvement of microwave energy\n\nBUUUUUUT the skeptics are always right, aren't they?

I've had a very similar dream a few months back. Basically, it was daytime and I was outside with friends going for a walk. We all looked up to see a huge-wave (thousands) of UFO's flying the skies. My friends run in different-directions. I guess I just stood there staring at the unusual-looking craft as it got closer. It was light-grey. \n\nThe bottom half was shaped like the handle of a pistol, very similar to [this image](http://tacticaltrainingsolutions.com/images/UTG/rb-pgrp478-m%20AK47%20Pistol%20Grip.jpg). The top half-went forward/straight like a pistol for maybe 30-feet, the end(tip I guess) was flat and circular. At the very front of the top half was a black-bubble, it was mostly-opaque but had just enough transparency to see inside, into the cockpit. Hard to explain. There were indentations and markings and vents on the craft.\n \nNext thing I know, I'm in the woods somewhere looking at a docked craft on the ground. I realize that I'm Looking directly at an extraterrestrial-being through the bubble-thing and she's intently staring right back at me. The bubble opens. \n\nFast-forward...I'm face to face with a beautiful-being. There was an overwhelming-emotion of love. This feeling or emotion, I never had experienced in real-life was just so strong I cried with joy within my dream. \n\nHer eyes resembled that of the cliche "grays", her mouth was much like ours but smaller and she had lips. Her head was the same size as ours. She had teeth/tongue and she spoke. When she spoke she said words, but I only heard them in my head(I don't know how that makes sense).\n\nI replied through thought. This being smiled the whole time and told me not to be afraid. She lead me to her craft, I sat inside and remember everything inside being black. the seats, instruments, walls, everything.\n\nThe seats were awesome as fuck. I can't even explain them. As I sat there... something started to feel very wrong, but she reassured me that everything will be OK.\n\nI then asked her "Are you going to hurt me"? She replied in a half-whisper in my head, and I quote(I guess): "*Yes, but it won't be painful*". She smiled the biggest, most sincere-smile and then I woke up. It's my favorite dream.	1329250059

The various strains I have are not used because I want to fuck around and experience every high. I grew them because different strains help for different things. Certain strains make my back feel amazing, while other do nothing for the pain. Some make my anxiety and depressions much more manageable, while some make them worse.\n\nI have gone through about five or six different anxiety and depression meds, and the only one that worked was the most recent one I took: Buspirone. It needed to be taken twice daily: when I got up and when I had lunch. It gave me intense lightheadedness for 2-3 hours after taking it. With the medicinal marijuana, I can smoke at night and be fine throughout almost the entire next day without feeling high. \n\nAnd by the way, before you start saying that I'm a smugly incorrect person, you might want to look at yourself.	1327783373

The problem is that this may be people just seeing what they want. For example, in the picture you linked to that looks "exactly like a modern depiction of the electron cloud", it could easily have been something else. I mean if I were in 3rd grade and drew a bunch of symmetric doodles on my notepad, would future generations be like "this genius drew something that looked like 2 quantum entangled particles, he must have known before we did!", when really I was drawing no such thing?  \nI mean if they had that kind of knowledge of electrons you think they would be able to depict it a little clearer. \n\nAs for ancients knowing such advanced astronomy that in theory they couldn't have known at all due to their tech limits, that is the main reason why I believe in the ancient alien hypothesis. 	1315280355

I had a very similar experience. I spent a trip thinking about the world really being vibrations relative to each other and came to think about many ideas from high-level string theory and such that I had never been exposed to before.

What I thought: Oh look. It's a white blur. What camera was use for this because using a 360p quality is just unacceptable, a mobile phone camera has more quality than that. When was this taken. You also have to take into account the fact that you're filming this in a moving vehicle, it coud be a reflection of someone moving their hand/face etc inside the car or reflection of something reflection off of the windshield. How do you know it's a ghost? The youtube video calls it a ghost but it should be labeled "unexplained phenomena." Also, what's with the "spooky music" it's the equivalent of the mass media using the X-files music whenever they talk about strange sights in the skies.	1341375134

I have a tendency to disregard anything captured with a cell phone camera. The resolution is always so poor, and artifacts are extremely common in these low quality photos.

I don't believe this photo is intentionally faked, but it's impossible to determine if it's paranormal or not.	1343391201
I don't get it. you seem to be acting out defensively and irrationally. Nobody is coming after you singing about stars; that's all in your head. UFOs are described as such because we don't know what they are. By predetermining what is allowed and not allowed, you are beginning with ignorance as a starting point. That's not a scientific nor is it a smart approach.\n\nUltimately, this all seems like its simply "Stop liking what I don't like!". Just ignore it; it doesn't have to affect you.	1328138306
I'm going to tie this back to what is going on today.\n\nPeople who don't vote are similar to people who don't take vaccines. They think about themselves and not about the community or society that they are apart of. They think well I'll have no effect if I vote/don't get a vaccine, but if a whole society thought that way, it would lead to ruin.\n\nEveryone in a society getting a vaccine helps the society as a whole because you get a "herd immunity." Even the people for whom the vaccine won't work are protected because they don't have neighbors that can pass on the disease. When you say no to vaccines, you think about only the potential benifits to yourself, and not to the damage you're doing to society.\n\nThe same goes for voting. People who say "well what will MY impact be" are thinking selfishly. They are thinking about how this election will effect them personally and not about how the society as a whole can benifit from an active and civicly involved citizenry.\n	1288722940

&gt;The idea that, generally, 'religion doesn't make any scientific claims' is undeniably true. The 'scientific' and testable claims that they sometimes do make are largely irrelevant and tangential to the religion itself. Taking the bible for example, I don't think anyone (even the most ardent of believers) would argue that it should be read as a textbook, but instead it's supposed to be a persuasive tool. \n\nI generally respect your opinion... But here I just completely disagree, and strongly suspect that you were not brought up religious, or if you were it was something like Church of England.\n\nAs someone who was raised Christian, the creation the existence of Adam and Eve are fundamental, without it you don't have original sin and the fall from grace, that removes the reason for Christ coming to sacrifice himself in order to redeem us, etc etc.\n\nI realise that more sophisticated theologians don't take the Adam and Eve story seriously, and the Catholic Church officially accepts evolution, though many Catholics don't themselves... But accepting evolution causes big problems, and requires stories about the human soul being inserted at some point in our evolutionary history, and that causes problems.\n\n&gt;The idea that, generally, 'religion doesn't make any scientific claims' is undeniably true.\n\nPerhaps the problem is with what you mean by general though... Perhaps you mean something like if we were to take all, most, or even just many, religions and then look at the intersections of those beliefs... Then perhaps they're not making scientific claims... In general though I would say that religions on do make scientific claims.	1341803452

&gt;doesn't do anything to support it as a reasonable treatment for cancer,\n\n"Reasonable" is a subjective term.  If it means even short-term, temporary relief from cancer symptoms, that **is** a form of treatment. Additionally, there are no side effects, and it comes relatively cheap. \n\n&gt;decreasing progression of tumors in humans.\n\nNo kidding. But trials start with animal testing, and the positive results on mice are quite promising for humans.\n\n&gt;That's very simple, even for a layman, to understand.\n\neasy there cowboy, we're all still very impressed with your initial long-winded title you name dropped back there. No need to overdo it on the self-righteousness.\n\n&gt;If you've got an agenda to push regarding Vitamin C\n\nYeah, I work for Big Vitamin.  Busted. \n\nNo, but seriously, I'm not going to apologize b/c I'm not *immediately* pushing for manmade, chemical treatments. Working in your field, you're clearly biased and will immediately push your manmade drug agenda. And that's fine.  Drugs have their place, but sadly, considering *legal* prescription drugs kill 10's of thousands of Americans every year, I think it's time we reconsider their immediate "go-to" status, and start to consider *cheap*, and *natural* (and of course effective) treatments, like, say vitamins.  Vitamins are food to the human body. Drugs are not.  No one is dying or getting sick b/c of a lack of acetylsalicylic acid, but you *can* at least become seriously ill from a lack of Vitamin C.\n\n&gt;insist that these trials tell you everything you need to know,\n\nI'm surprised someone of your apparent caliber is making such a strawman attack. I did not say "These are the end-all-be-all Vitamin C proofs - Vitamin C cures cancer!!!" and certainly **not** that they're everything you need to know. Ironically, that's *exactly* what you were doing with your initial link and post when you snidely dismissed IV Vitamin C as any kind of treatment.  *You* immediately dismissed it, making it sound like nothing more than a placebo, at best.  **I** only ever said what can be backed up by these studies: that, at the very least, Vitamin C *can* relieve certain cancer patients with short term relief from their cancer symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n	1332944689

Everything we know, to some extent, is based on personal experience. Even science is based on personal experience and human interpretation. If human experience and perception is so fallible, then science itself is a ridiculous fancy of a bunch of children bumbling about blindly in the dark.\n\nPersonally, I don't regard ghosts, etc. as requiring extraordinary evidence because I don't view it as extraordinary. People see the words "paranormal" and "supernatural" or any concept that falls under that umbrella and immediately start braying because it's illogical. Personally, I try to keep my head on about it.\n\nI regard many of these concepts to be so widespread culturally and ongoing throughout human history that I'm willing to give them some level of credence. On the other hand, I view the "supernatural" as simply a natural that we don't yet understand, probably relating to quantum mechanics and things of that nature.	1335476634
&gt; Well, I've read Robert Anton Wilson's books and I've read tons of conspiracy theory bullshit over the last 20+ years, and I still can't say I believe there's definitely an "Illuminati" despite knowing someone who claimed to know someone whose family was tied to Them.\n\nThis is your problem, you are looking at this as if you're living in a fucking comic book with this "despite knowing someone who claimed to know someone *whose family was tied to Them*" ..seriously? Like what do you think this is? Some group of super-villains performing black magic at some solid gold or mahogany table somewhere, maybe with some kind of control over every single thing in the world?\n\n"The illuminati" is such a stupid term, just take a moment and look at the word - it's just a word, after all. It means "illuminated", as in, one who sees the light(generally held to be 'the light' of reason - both abstract and practical reasoning on a scale that most people don't and can't imagine), they know, they have minds of their own, they are alive and above the masses(who themselves are very similar to animals or to the dead - always running through their lives but never really getting anywhere, scurrying about doing the work of others to survive and never leaving a lasting imprint on the world that they found themselves in).\n\nIt's just a term used to describe the philosophical, intellectual, or social elite. It's not new, and it's not something somebody invented as part of a conspiracy theory. Get rid of your Robert Anton Wilson books and stop thinking in such polarized, black and white ways - all the while thinking you're doing the opposite because you're reading RAW.\n\nSure maybe at one point somebody came up with a nice little fraternal order they dubbed 'The Illuminati' - that's irrelevant. You have to start examining for yourself the meaning behind the meaning and the implications of things rather than taking everything at face value like hearing the word "illuminati" and thinking immediately "oh that's a conspiracy group! 9/11 man reptilians man!" or something.\n\nReally, it's not the people who don't believe in an illuminati who are logical and rational - they are like little children who are unable to reason for themselves. There has always been a philosophical and intellectual elite, and there always will be - **there has also always been a predatory elite ruling class, the members of which who fall into the other category as well(of 'philosophical/intellectual elite') we could reasonably call 'the illuminati',  and it's a club you aren't invited to, it's one you're either born into or not, either by blood, position, or brain  - but since the term has been so muddied by idiots on both sides of the brain-dead fence, both conspiracy nuts and conspiracies-don't-exist nuts, it's best to avoid, because the word is so often misunderstood  by people like Nnnslogan, and taken away from reason and into fantasy - fantasy believed or disbelieved, but still fantasy.**	1333089136

Oh, so you think they lied to Congress do you???\n\nAnd, fracking fluid is recycled - and they don't use very much of the stuff (they hold it in portable above-ground pools, similar to swimming pools).  And, fracking fluid is 99% water.\n\nAlso, you don't appear to know what your talking about.  They flare natural gas from oil wells when the gas isn't worth capturing - not gas wells.\n\nEDIT:  Notice how the comment above shows absolutely no understanding of natural gas extraction and, in fact, mixes up oil wells and natural gas wells - yet has more than 6x as many upvotes than downvotes?  While, I get way more downvotes than upvotes for pointing that out?	1347043409

The term is used by Josephus and Pliny the Younger, both of whom were dead by 120AD, as well as Ignatius and Polycarp in the mid 2nd century. It was apparently the accepted appellation by the time Tacitus was writing. So your first assertion is demonstrably wrong. Your second claim is both vague and nonsensical.\n\nBoth are irrelevant.	1355855839

How long has this been known? In 1993 I got verbally abused by a guy before I could finish a sentence where I was going to suggest philosophically that perhaps global warming is natural in the sense that since we're part of the environment, if we destroy ourselves it would be normal. I've always been skeptical of it and kept a distance from the debate ever since because it seemed like the fervor surrounding the issue was almost religious in nature. Especially when four or five years ago people were excited that there was finally a scientific consensus.	1335274569
I think that viewpoint in intellectually irresponsible because it lends validity to ideas that aren't supported by evidence. There is no legitimate evidence to support the aquatic spy hypothesis in the same way that the HIV-AIDS connection has been well established or that there are no real climate scientists that would deny the connection between humans and climate change. The only real difference between those examples is the inherent danger in ignoring the latter two. It's one thing provide a way to share new ideas, but they shouldn't be giving a platform for ideas that have been presented before but can't stand up to scientific scrutiny.	1355273178
At the level of actually teaching it is a science vs religion issue.   The creationists would be the ones who would call themselves 'skeptics' in this case.  I personally use skepticism to refer to issues that need investigation or is somehow not resolved.  However, there is nothing to debunk or even investigate when it comes to creationism.  \n\nConcerning the teaching of creationism in the class as a policy, this is a political and religious issue.	1310319700

It's actually a fundamental part of Shakespearian structure. The plot is advanced often by noble, idealistic, mendacious or vicious characters. These serious characters ponder the ineffable, the sublime and the vile.\n\nMeanwhile there are secondary characters scampering about making jokes or serious critiques of the primary characters positions. The secondaries delight in irony and love to expose the self-deceit of the primary characters.\n\nThat's just stylistic, though. Even the plots are practically morality plays in favor of skepticism.\n\n*Othello* is a fine example. All the "good guys" act in good faith and are excessively credulous, but they are fundamentally antagonists. The villain of the piece, Iago, is the protagonist, and he advances his agenda through guile. Othello is entirely a tragedy about a man who would have been safe if he were skeptical but is instead convinced by circumstantial evidence.\n\nI don't know where Shakespeare would have sat on issues of modern skepticism, but it's pretty clear he was in favor of the skeptical mindset. The skeptics get many of the best lines.\n\n\n	1323129061

The issue I have is that this "positive effect" comes at a significant cost. It allows individuals to be fully disconnected from reality, allowing them to be more susceptible to believing the other more harmful woo. It perpetuates the idea that  things grounded in woo are as valid as scientific methods. Although some woo is pretty tame, there are significant society-wide implications for other woo -- broken herd immunity from not vaccinating comes to mind.	1337103032

Well don't get me wrong, I don't mean to knock hundreds and hundreds of experimenters through volunteer first-hand experience casual folks. In fact, my father was an experimenter through volunteer first-hand experience casual folk. And his father before that.\n\nPlease do not misconstrue any of what I have said as being derogatory towards hundreds and hundreds of experimenters through volunteer first-hand experience casual folks or in any way calling in to question the claims of hundreds and hundreds of experimenters through volunteer first-hand experience casual folks.\n\nI am merely saying that, as compelling as hundreds and hundreds of experimenters through volunteer first-hand experience casual folks are, you really need to have something published in the literature to be taken seriously in the field of *science*. \n\nWhat you are practicing, and advocating, is pseudoscience. You and the hundreds and hundreds of experimenters through volunteer first-hand experience casual folks are classic pseudoscientific proponents.\n\nWhile his receiving the highest award the Ontario Public Broadcasting Channel can bestow upon a lecturer is, admittedly, quite impressive, I am not certain that it constitutes proof of whatever theories he may happen to dream up. \n\nI have so many questions for you.

It is gentle on the beliefs themselves (including religion) but amusingly and efficiently demolishes the mechanisms for protecting those beliefs.\n\nHis chapter on "Going Nuclear" is especially good: it addresses the argument that since reason itself can't be justified by reason, my faith claim is no different from your faith that solipsism is false.	1308666098

If you're wanting to consider it urban exploration, that's a whole different monster. Great fun! Aside from creeping eachother out though, your odds of finding anything paranormal are pretty slim. When I do investigations, my favorite part is the history lesson. I love finding a piece of property and learning its history, then I try to find details within the building that coincide with what I've learned of the place. While I go about this, I run recorders and cameras, and occasionally pick up interesting, unexplainable things. If you do happen to catch anything you suspect might be paranormal though, don't bother showing it around. Nobody will believe it unless they were there when it was captured. Have fun, be safe, but remember, trespassing can land you in a whole heap of trouble!	1328702228

it is a "voltage stabilizer" if you want to research it.

I believe it could actually potentially help in an old car.\n\ni am not an expert on cars or electronics.  this is based off of 5 minutes of research.	1309629653
Precedent has been established that Christians aren't schizo or have mal-intent.

For burns or rashes, it might be okay, but then again, any clay would probably provide some soothing.  On the other hand, there are tons of other products that can relieve that pain.  \n\nAny other claims are likely bullshit, especially when they start talking about toxins.  \n\nEdit:  by further looking, there is some evidence for the use of clay dermatologically, and apparently there are some heavy metal absorption properties of clay (this is without examining the source from the wikipedia article about the specific type of clay) , but I would pretty much think it impossible to absorb anything through the skin.  And unless she is experiencing symptoms of heavy metal poisoning, she probably doesn't need to be "detoxified"  and if she is, please take her to the hospital.  It also has laxative properties, and as we all know, getting detoxified is about shitting, a lot.  \n\nIf she wants to use this, she can find cheaper sources montmorillonite / bentonite clay.  To find bentonite clay, look at home brewing supply places.  While your at it, order some stuff to start home brewing.  Gotta justify the shipping costs *wink wink*	1330928156
The zinc lozenges in question there are labelled as “homeopathic” for some reason.

So, I had a long post here, and just lost it all thanks to a bluescreen (ATI, your death will not be quick!)\n\nIt's gonna take me a bit to want to retype that.  \n\nHere's the gist, in case you'd like to respond in the meantime.  \n\nReason I brought up allergies, is your friend's reaction, inflammation, is normally due to a histamine reaction (allergy) if no other reason for it to happen is available.  I also have brought it up, as many people incorrectly claim an allergy to msg.  I agree that we have gone on to sensitivity, but I still feel it is safe to say it is non-existant.\n\nIf there are several stable isotopes of glutamic acid, I'm sure they'd show up in the studies already conducted, where no one showed any sensitivity.  \n\nNiacin doesn't work in this argument because it's an essential nutrient.  I know of niacin sensitivity, it is caused by large doses of niacin doing exactly what niacin does.  It also tends to go away after repeated doses.  I am not a doctor, I cannot tell you why this happens, but I do have enough basic knowledge of chemistry to tell you that this is much like sodium.  Sodium is an essential nutrient, and can have severe side effects if too much is taken.\n\nFinally, Health Canada, I had not heard of before this argument, I have no opinion on them, but even going on their article, their wording is "some individuals may have a sensitivity".  some, and may.  This sentence still holds true if no one has this sensitivity.  \n\nThe FDA's ruling was by a Select Committee.  These are not medical professionals.  They are elected officials.  The US has a long history of electing laymen to make scientific rulings.  There are many cases where they have been off, or outright wrong, and others where they have disregarded the advice of scientific council.  There is no study listed, no advisor listed, nothing.  Just the select committee.  \n\nFinally, your last line is a straw-man argument.  Please refrain from them.  They do not aid this conversation, and I could throw the same type of ad-hominem attack against your arguments.  \n\nI am at no point trying to be argumentative, or insisting that my view is right.  I am saying that without a peer reviewed study showing msg sensitivity, I see no reason to believe it exists, when sodium sensitivity is much more plausible.  The reason I am asking for a study, is that as a skeptic, I would like empirical evidence.  Having this information on a website, no matter its legitimacy, does not make it fact without some provable phenomena.  \n\nSo there's a wall of text, and much more than I meant to type, so I will probably not retype my original response.  Simply put, empirical evidence will stop me from making this claim.  I have empirical evidence that supports my theory.  If you can refute that evidence, please do so, but until then, I stand by it.	1337848492

It's an interesting hypothesis but there are a few issues I have with it. First, there is no evidence of genetic manipulation, implied in the article. Moreover, there is no reason for it. Even with our limited knowledge of chemistry and biology, we were able to create replicating bacteria in a lab. Imagine what beings capable of interstellar, maybe even intergalactic, travel can do? What that article is suggesting is simply too slow and not practical.\n\nThen again, if these are aliens we're talking about, their technology may have evolved via different mechanisms than ours. So I guess it's possible.	1343440359

Actually, it can be that simple if the OP picks the right location. As you stated, you and your husband walked into a haunted location, and as soon as you walked in, you had an experience that took at least 30 minutes to recover from. I spent the night at Waverly Hills back in 2008 and had several experiences that were real enough to remove any doubt of the existence of ghosts. In today's world, with video, photo and audio editing software, the chances of capturing any kind of "proof" of paranormal are practically nil. The only evidence that can prove the existence of ghosts is personal experience, and that only proves it to the person having the experience. Therefore, the best bet for the OP is to put himself in a location that increases his odds of having an experience of his own. As for ghost hunters, they lost all credibility in my eyes when it was proven that they fake evidence for the sake of entertainment. I realize that they pretty much had to, to keep their viewer numbers up. It didn't help any when they started having pro wrestlers, washed up musicians, and the real housewives of whatever as guests either. I can't even force myself to sit through an episode these days. Paranormal TV is a waste of time, unless you view it purely as a source of entertainment. 	1340281096

According to a theory out there, there are many alternate realities and different things happen at the same time and sometimes same thing happen with different people if this makes sense.\nThe fact that you saw someone that "wasn't there" could be that particles from the other reality switched realities a little more vividly than normal causing you to see what is happening elsewhere at the sametime. If this makes sense. This theory also states that a particle that a person observes will take up two different places at the same time on the same plane (or reality) but that particle instead of being destroyed will disappear and show up in another reality. This causes people to see "ghosts" or the like. This also explains why things happen for no reason. If you want better information then watch a movie called "What the Bleep do we Know." Really good movie but it is all theory.	1339481368

I think similar cell phone things have been posted here before.

It sounds interesting and I've heard other instances of shared dreams and had one myself. Sometimes details can be too specific for it to all just be a coincidence; dreaming the same thing, at the same night, from different point point of views. If you believe that the brain and mind are separate entities than that leaves the idea of people meeting up in an "astral dimension" possible. Remember that lucid dreaming wasn't even taken seriously by the scientific community until the 1960's and it wasn't proven, until the 1980's; so before you dismiss it as a coincidence, I suggest you look into it further.	1335675280

There are many questionable organizations, diploma-mills if you want, that charge you enormous amounts of money for worthless degrees, and without teaching you anything useful.\n\n**Edit:** It's a large site, but also have a look at [Quackwatch](http://www.quackwatch.com/) every now and then. It helps keeping the good stuff and the bad stuff in the medical world apart. If you truly want to help people, it is absolutely imperative that you know what *works* and what's just fantasy.	1296761688

Yes, which is not surprising, since humans usually inhabited near rivers that are prone to floods. However, only in some of those legends is a god deciding to wipe humanity except for a single family, who constructs a boat and saves some animals with them. And this one in particular talks about how lifespans before the flood were enourmous, something that myths in other areas do not have.	1355256874

I think you are entitled to your beliefs, but this kind of thing is not about paranormal work, which is (or at least should be) scientific inquiry into unexplained phenomena.

That's right. Something like the the VP is doomed to fail from the start because it fails at a fundamental level of taking the laws of economics and human nature into account. Also, I believe they're completely basing this whole project on speculation and anecdotes. As far as I'm aware, there have been no experiments and there has been no hard data or evidence to suggest a project like that would work. People have examined and shot holes in the ideology that is the VP, yet the founders and followers alike disregard it and staunchly defend it even though their project has been shown that it can't last.\n\nTrying to talk someone, such as a believer of the VP, out of something they willingly got themselves into, is akin to attempting to convince a theist via debate that their god doesn't (or can't) exist. Trying to debate, or otherwise convince someone their idea is wrong through heated discussion, will end in failure the vast majority of the time because during such an activity, the brain naturally goes into a defensive mode where efforts to convince the person otherwise will not be successful. The person you want to change must willingly change and that takes time and effort on their part. If they do it willingly on their own, the defensive mechanisms in the brain tend to subside and the person more readily accepts the new ideas. So the trick is getting the person to doubt their position enough that they would willingly go out and read and try to understand the arguments against their ideology. Persuading them is rather tough though, and a lot of people aren't that willing to put that much time and effort into such an endeavor.\n\nThis guy lays out why the VP is fundamentally flawed: [The science that is missing and completely wrong in the Venus Project](http://anticultist.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/the-science-that-is-missing-and-completely-wrong-in-the-venus-project/)	1314200521

"the actual reactions that took place in the laboratory by bombarding Americium-243 with Calcium-48, which resulted in the two Isotopes of Element 115, indicated below, being identified."\n\n\n"The maximum theoretical atomic mass isotope of Element 115 that could be produced in the reaction, above, 115UUP291, would only have 176 neutrons in its nucleus.  This isotope of Element 115 is shy 8 neutrons from containing the magic number of 184 neutrons.  The two actual isotopes of Element 115 produced by this reaction, 115UUP288 and 115UUP287 contain 173 neutrons, shy 11 neutrons from the magic number of 184, and 172 neutrons, shy 12 neutrons from the magic number of 184, respectively."\nhttp://www.gravitywarpdrive.com/Element_115.htm#Table\n\nThey have other listed sources there.\n\nSo you're looking to copy the nuclear configuration of Bismuth if you want a stable isotope which Lawrence Livermore Labs were not able/did not want to do.	1297719620

If you can't see the fundamental difference (other than scale) between being rude about people's beliefs and racism, I don't have anything to say to you, you're just a lost cause. \n\nAnd if you can't understand the concept that "it's OK to be an asshole as long as you don't intend for any of the people you're being an asshole to to hear about it" is bullshit, you're just as lost.\n\n&gt;you might convince society to deem religious thinking to be socially unacceptable, which, in the end, achieves the same thing.\n\nTake a lesson from MLK. He didn't go around calling white people fucking stupid, and if he had, civil rights legislation would likely still be tabled.

The sceptic in me takes this as a fabricated story written to draw users to a website. However I don't have a good idea of the reputation of the website. At the same time the fact that they are unwilling to release a video reinforces the possibility that it is a genuine ETI case, I mean, what other reason would they have to withhold the footage? The article suggests that maybe the "robot"-like UFO could be Chinese techology sent to India with supposedly slight malicious intentions. However, if india realizes this, why would they be so quick to withholding said footage? 	1351994582

I agree, I got robbed at knifepoint in uk. The whole drive there I had an uneasy feeling. While I was being robbed my phone kept ringing and it was my gf at the time saying she felt like something was wrong and needed to check up (obviously heard that after)\n\nI could totally feel it coming. \n\nWhen I was younger I used to abuse solvents, and always got a feeling of dejavu as well as something unexplainable. Later in life (a few years) and again abusing the solvents god knows why.. and again with this dejavu..\n\nBtw if you don't know, i've come to realise heavy solvent abuse doesn't bring on a 'high'. It's bringing on a near death experience which is why you feel like your mind is at one with the universe.. you're dying..\n\nSo this uneasy dejavu matches the uneasy feeling from abusing solvents years previously.. and as my vision scews I realise i'm in the same place I was in years ago when I foresaw this moment.. \n\nEvolution.\n\nThis post is not a joke or sarcastic, seriously.	1350138331

First off, great question. I personally believe this planet has been visited by extraterrestrials in the past and present. If you look at history the evidence is there. You have the Nazca lines, relics of the Mayan civilization that allude to them having contact with a higher being, the pyramid phenomenon around the wold, and etc. Presently, I think we're being visited without a doubt. There's enough eyewitness testimony, videos, pictures and a government that does not want to investigate the matter seriously. In fact I think there's a huge coverup and misinformation campaign on UFOs in general. The government, hollywood, and the media of successfully made the UFO question a laughing matter.  	1316564461

Michael Shermer is awesome. Here's a true story to show his awesomeness:  \n\nAbout 6 years ago I worked at a local newspaper with about 100 employees. There was a book shelf in the lunch room for people to swap used books. Well a bunch of the fundie christian women started filling it up with christian literature. No big deal, to each his own I always say. Well, I decided to put some skeptic/atheist books on the shelf. What happens? They're all gone almost immediately, like $120 worth of books. I go to throw out my lunch and I see them all in the trash with the covers ripped off.  \n\nI emailed the Skeptic Society and told my story, and Michael Shermer himself emailed me back saying he'd send me some skeptical goodies to put in the library. A week later I get a huge box delivered to my house. He sent me all his books, a bunch of pamphlets and a few miscellaneous skeptical books. I tell ya, it was hard not to keep them but I gradually added them to the company library.	1264779235

&gt; I live 5 miles from the nearest town and police... My neighbor used his gun to detain an intruder that barged in on his wife until the sheriff's deputy got there. If I lived somewhere else, I might have a lot of stories of friends getting shot by guns, but so far they seem to have saved more lives around me than taken them away.\n\nThis is the thing that people who live in rural areas need to understand (and it seems that you do). A gun means something completely different in Tulsa, Oklahoma that it means on the south side of Chicago. I understand the Constitutional arguments against gun control and I can accept them. But rural Americans need to understand that urban Americans see dozens of people killed by guns for every person they see saved by guns.\n\nHere's my grand compromise: Strike the Second Amendment completely. Craft language that leaves gun control unconstitutional at the Federal level but makes it constitutional at the state and local level. Oklahoma would never pass gun control, but Los Angeles, Chicago and New York will have every single gun outlawed by the next night. I'd like to hear a modern, State's Rights conservative argue against that solution.	1343176886

Wow, seven laptops! I have trouble with laptop failures too ... but not anywhere at that level. \n\nThis happens to me too, but it's not constant, daily thing. I will go through a period of a few days once or twice a year in which everything electronic that I get near breaks, crashes, fails, etc. At first I thought it was that the electronics were all simply reaching their "planned obsolescence" at the same time, but then I noticed it couldn't be the case because it happens to items I purchased at different times, or to other people's electronics. I have ruled out static electricity as well, because in most cases I don't even need to touch the items -- just get near them. \n\nThe last time it happened in the span of 3 days my (only 3 month old) laptop fried, the electronics in my 8 year old car toasted next, I blew out not one but both land lines in the house,  the microwave AND the dishwasher conked out (both cases turned out to be electrical issues). \n\nIf you google around, you will see we are not alone. \n\n\n	1327862990

I understand why it sounds like such a facile statement.\n\n[This talks helps provide the necessary foundation](http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/202214-1) for what it means. It is actually a rather easy set of general guidelines. "Eat well" can be problematic, since "well" is ultimately influenced by possibly wrong general guideline.\n\nWhile people should be wary of the naturalistic fallacy and argument from antiquity, it is still useful to consider that we evolved along with the evolution of various types of food available. Rapid changes in available food could conceivably happen faster than our biological adaptation, with those individuals who are conscious of what they choose being more fit to achieve better health.	1317081594
Well, I'm not sure what you mean by arcs.  From what I perceived as I watched, they traveled relatively straight, or perhaps in a long arc.  If you are referring to shorter arcs, or sudden movements, I believe those are entirely due to my poor camera phone work.  You might be right about the speed though... It would help a lot to know what altitude they were at.  All I can say is that the speed seemed to be relatively constant in that as it was overhead the speed was much quicker compared to the background, and as it approached the horizon it slowed in comparison to the background in a way that suggested constant velocity.  I am fairly certain they were not aircraft, the travel across the sky was too fast for that.	1343600725
Yeah... except that at take of and landing, it can be literally seconds. If all they have time to do is yell "We're going down, BRACE!" that's the warning you get. If part of your reaction time is pulling out your headphones or hanging up your phone call, rather than instantly putting your head between your knees, that might be all you get.\n\nYou would think that you would notice the plane taking a nose dive, but your reaction would more likely to be "hmm, something is wrong, I better pull out my headphones" having already missed the one and only intercom call you get. \n\nIf you doubt me, go listen to black box recordings of plane crashes. For example, PSA-182 going down they had almost no time to react. Granted everyone died anyhow, but my point is you have basically no time to react, and you want to use that time to follow whatever few instructions you might get.	1356952141

Ive never shared this with anyone but here goes:\n\nAs long as I could remember Ive been having nightmares about being abducted. My dreams would often be interrupted by an alien of several common types as described by others and cause me to loose control of my body/voice in my dream. At this point I would normally wake up in a cold sweat. These aliens often appear out of no where in my dreams often while Im dreaming about something completely unrelated. But as soon as I recognize it is an alien I immediately lose control of my voice and body. I often have these dreams in conjunction with a house I used to live in as a child. The earliest dream I could remember was me waking my brother up asking him to look at a light outside, Im not even sure if this exactly was a dream either. Another one I remember was an insect with familiar alien eyes flying outside my window trying to get in. An incredibly vivid one was one where I am in my house and I realize that the aliens are coming,  I resign myself to the fate and upon seeing the aliens I extend my hand and say something to the effect of "nice seeing you guys again" to which the lead alien a tall gray immediately and telepathically told me "That is not necessary". There were different types of aliens there including one that was tall and odd looking but similar to a type that people have described in the past. Then smaller grays grabbed my hand and lead me outside to a very bright light through my front door. Mind you that all these dreams are occuring in a house I have not lived in for 14 years or so. I have never done regression hypnosis so I can only remember these dreams. Ive heard that some abductees often have frightening and vivid nightmares such as mine but it could also be that I have had a lot of interest in aliens for as long as I could remember. \n\ntl:dr - I may or may not have been adbucted	1351573548

The last step in the plan to militarize Earth and protect its caste-system, is to militarize space. And we can't do that without an "alien threat."\n\nI've been hearing about reptilians for some time. 2001 or so. The only problem is that there's not a lot of eyewitness testimony. And the testimony that there is, is extraordinarily unreliable -- in a field where reliability is already a question!\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I've seen demons. I've heard them. I've felt them. Their fundamental rule is to emphasize separate states. Disunity and disharmony. They're pretty much everywhere, just nagging ideas to the untrained eye.\n\nCan I imagine a whole species dominated by archons (eg, reptilians)? No. Can I cite Galaxy Quest, V, the snake in the garden of Eden, the Dragon of St. Michael ... as evidence for the existence of reptilians? No. (Especially when you consider that man's limbic brain is somewhat reptilian to begin with.)	1351523372

&gt;Because one group has had 2 months less of sex than the other group and that the two groups weren't deviating, they were just remaining separated\n\nSo basically, you're arguing that abstaining from sex for 2 months will result in a 60% reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV over the next 2 years. \n\n&gt;It's pretty tiny given the size of the samples, the numerous biases, the flawed methodology, and various other confounds\n\nActually, it's pretty close to the result seen with similar studies looking at other interventions for reducing the risk of HIV infection. Looking at the pre-exposure prophylaxis studies, for instance, in the [iPrEX study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1011205) there were 36 infections in the intervention group and 64 in the control group after a median of 1.2 years (N = 2499). Likewise in the [TDF2 study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1110711), there were 9 infections in the intervention group and 24 in the control group after a mean of 1.1 years (N = 1219). In the [Partners PrEP study](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1108524) there were 13 infections in the intervention group and 52 in the control group (N = 4758).\n\nThe studies were conducted in similar populations and give very similar results. 	1346246234

Eating a controlled diet will reduce your chances of developing diabetes but I've never heard of fasting one day and eating normally the next.

&gt;load of shit, we made up time (man)..time in other solar systems is different to time in ours, cause all it is based upon is the orbit of the sun, our night and day..Time isnt a real thing, its just something we use to measure..this guys a nut\n\nYou are wrong. Time is a fundamental dimension of the universe, hence space-time. Time would exist just as it does now with or without human beings existing to experience it. Time is not a man-made construct. We simply observe it. Time exists as a constant, and we invented the clock measuring system to track its passage. For more information, see Einstein's Theory of Relativity.	1344955069

I concede your point on the difference between murder and manslaughter. However, I still have a problem with seeing what they did as negligent. As you say, negligence is about failing to meet a standard of care but I feel that deliberately withholding care is a different matter.  \n  \n[Here's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-15466999) another example that doesn't involve any beliefs. This child was burned when she was held in a scolding shower and died up to a fortnight later from the burns. Look at the prosecuter's comment right at the end.  \n  \n&gt; A total failure of both these two defendants to seek medical attention may well have been because both knew that Eva Logina had done this and both therefore wished, given the relationship, to avoid the obvious consequences of bringing it to the attentions of people who could treat it because they were gross injuries.  \n  \nThe mother was charged with manslaughter and child cruelty, but I have a hard time considering that to be neglect. Maybe it's not murder as they never intended their victim to die, but it should be consdered more than being criminally negligent.  \n  \nNINJA EDIT: I decided to look up manslaughter to get my head around it better. I found out that [involuntary manslaughter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter#Involuntary_manslaughter) contains two types: constructive and criminally negligent manslaughter. Constructive manslaughter is pretty much what I was talking about, therefore my entire arguement is now rendered void. I shall leave my post up as it took me a while to type.	1320331797

That's not accurate either.  \n\nThe 9/11 Truth movement (for lack of a better term) has an enormous amount of credible data - much much more than the official story:\n\nhttp://patriotsquestion911.com/\n\n... the only people who still believe that the 9/11 Commission report describes an accurate story of how a bunch of cave-dwelling Saudi's (with nothing more than a couple of razor blades) orchestrated the most horrendous attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor... are now more commonly known as "9/11 Faithers" (given their blind-faith in Cheney/Bush dogma).\n\nMoving along... I do agree with you that there are a lot of anti-Government folks that have irresponsibly adopted the "9/11 Truth" movement as their own.  \n\nJust like the Republicans would love to drop the "Birthers" on the curb, so too would most of the authentic 9/11 Truthers (ie. military personal, engineers, architects, federal agents, etc) wish they could distance themselves from lunatic fringe.\n\nIn other words, not all Republicans are retarded "Birthers".  And not all Truthers are anti-Government nutcases.  \n\nIn fact, most Republicans pray the Birthers would just go away... just as most Truthers pray the anti-Government lunatics would just keep their craziness to themselves.\n\nFocus on the legitimate, well established research and information organizations for factual and rational Truth:\n\nhttp://www.ae911truth.org/\n\nRespectfully.	1249622272

I have experienced medical benefit from chiropractors, however it's nothing that I couldn't do on my own were I to study anatomy a little better. For instance, about twice a year (as a result of repetitive motion at work) I pinch a nerve in my left shoulder causing myself a mild dull ache. The first time it happened I went to the chiropractor, because he was a family friend and offered a free treatment. \n\nWhile I was there he showed me a way to stretch my neck to the opposite side of the pinched nerve, which when done regularly for 2-3 days relieves the pressure, and my shoulder stops hurting for a few months.\n\nSo in my experience, yes they can provide medical relief, but no more so than Jim down at the general store giving you advice.	1329427030
I think the approach here is all wrong. It is not your burden to disprove the hypotheses of homeopathy.

&gt;Citation needed. The amphetamines were initially researched by military to improve performance of healthy people, and the adderall[1] brand mix of amphetamines is commonly abused by healthy students for exams[2] .\n\nYou've just provided an example there - people without ADHD get a high, increased energy, and can pull all-nighters for days straight.

I've already explained how it could be falsified and you seem to have no argument against that.\n\n&gt;Which is utterly distinct from things like cancer and more similar to 'lump on the leg' or 'slow walking'.

You think being unable to function in society is comparable to not being a great athlete?!\n\nIt's more accurate to compare mental disorders to musculoskeletal disorders, where somebody's movement is impaired so that they struggle to climb stairs or walk long distances.

If that's the case, then I'm still correct in saying that it's scientific in at least the smallest possible way - the complexity is what allows for 'degrees' of scientificness...\n\nThis debate is similar to the [No True Scotsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) discussion. Dr. Long's work, however painfully wrong it may be, has some of the characteristics of the scientific method. Moreover [Layne_Staleys_Ghost's](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/lpqo1/no_words/c2umlq4) comment, in general terms, that the collection of anecdotes is not scientific in the smallest way possible is false.

When there are affordable preservatives available that have no mercury in them, I find it disingenuous to continue to use mercury. \n\nOn a mass production scale, I have a feeling that the extra cost to have 3 single-use vials instead of shipping vaccines in a 3-dose vial would be fairly affordable. Perhaps I'm wrong, and using single-dose vials would cause an undue strain on vaccine funding.\n\nIf I was provided with compelling evidence that there is absolutely no link between mercury and autism, I would support funding to continue research into finding the true cause of autism...that being said, \n\nI find it "reasonable" to embrace the concept that a small percentage of the population has a sensitivity to even trace amounts of mercury compounds. I have heard of children who have died from an allergic reaction to peanuts, so...can we agree that mercury should not be the first choice when selecting medical additives?	1350859884

Yes, this is true.

I'm shocked that the downvoting system here is used to get rid of comments people don't agree with, this is supposed to be a skeptic's community, it should promote (in a way) people disagreeing and discussing it properly. Instead we seem to still have the reddit voting system that gets rid of comments based entirely on how it makes us "feel". I know this has nothing to do with vaccinations, but 2 hidden comments (that are actually sharing calm opinions relevant to the topic) is not a good sign for this community.\n\nI do support vaccination (duh), but the idea of "forcing" it (which I don't think, based on what I read, they're fully doing?) raises issue of freedom/human rights. It's such a grey area, I can't say what I think about it. But I can imagine it getting worse if it's left alone, so I quite like the idea of them needing to prove their case so they can opt out. \n\nEdit: I'd also like to hear from everyone who is downvoting me, this is surely a community based on discussion? I got really excited when I found there was a skeptic's community on here, but it seems a little ruined by the voting system as usual. One which encourages quick, and emotional judgement.	1349685977

I worked there a couple of years. When I started having "experiences" I thought I must be a nut, so I asked a few people around who had worked there longer than me, and everybody had stories and told me not to worry. One person had experienced a full apparition, right where my office was. Another lady had experienced detatched footsteps running past her (as in hearing them but seeing nobody attached to the footsteps as they ran past her). All in all it was a pretty creepy place, but there was only one spot in the building that felt "menacing", and I'm pretty sure that was a different energy/entity to the one that pestered me all the time. In fact, the "menacing" one was enough to me that I stayed well away from that area at night. I'm getting chills right now just thinking about it, actually :/  The last straw for me was when I walked into the area where "it" was, and felt so uncomfortable, almost ill, and then, though it was the height of summer and over 30C outside, my breath condensed into fog clouds (yes, just like in the movies). It was freezing in there. So I just turn and got the fuck out. Never went back in there at night. 	1347423396

To pull a classic example assosciated with utilitarian ethics, you're coincidentally standing at a railroad switch just as a train is about to crash into a stalled bus on the railroad tracks. If you do nothing the train will crush the bus killing the people aboard. If you pull the railroad switch the train goes onto a different track where there is but a single person (stupidly) sitting down to enjoy their lunch with their back turned to the train. You don't have time to warn anyone. \n\nCertainly, this is an absurd hypothetical situation, but nonetheless there's a point to be made. If you're a Consequentialist (i.e.: you view ethical actions as whatever creates the greatest amount of good as you define it) then it's a simple choice, most likely pulling the switch is moral, not pulling it immoral, but that will of course depend on how you quantify good. If you adhere to most other ethical systems, this may be somewhat of a quandary, you can either act and be responsible for the death of one person who otherwise would have lived, or you can fail to act and more people will die. Unless I'm mistaken these actions are opposites of each other (acting vs. failing to act) [at least in one sense, I'm not completely sure how much I like viewing ethics in terms of opposites just because you can come up with more than opposite for many situations] yet it does not seem contradictory to say there seems to be something unethical about either choice you can make. It is not that you desire to be an "immoral bad guy" instead it's that you're in situation where differing ideals of morality conflict. Generally most of us do not look at ethical situations purely based on consequences, or purely based on duty; we use a mix of the two. As such, situations can arise (i.e.: the vaccination case) that you have conflicting moral impulses about, but, one impulse can be stronger than the other, and one should have reasons why one option is better than the other, but those reasons may not be the same between all people. \n\nPS: I don't actually think it's immoral to forcibly vaccinate at all.\n	1303929546

Alright, fair point ... lets do some do some self skepticism and apply a little analysis.\n\nI made a joke which apparently was considered inappropriate.  I didn't intend it that way, but I can see how it may have been seen as such.  I was then provided a link to the wikipedia page on bigotry .. with no explanation or comment on my joke, just a link which I'm assuming was an attempt at a clever way to call me a bigot.  Now, being a real person, as I'm sure most of us here are, I've had a number of jokes made at my expense and I've made jokes at others expense.  These jokes have come at the expense of everything from which hand I'm holding my beer in to the girls I date to my heritage to just about everything .. to jump to the conclusion of bigotry from repeating a common joke is a tad extreme.  I mean, if I had actually said something bigoted, there's nowhere to go from there.  By using the word in this way it dilutes it for when it's actually appropriate.\n\nNow I'm not going to get into my ethnicity or where I live or anything like that, but I will point out that if I was a lower middle class, gay black man living in a predominantly rich white upper suburban neighborhood .. being called a bigot for a vegetarian joke would be offensive to me, which I'll explain in a sec.\n\nI then responded with a shock response .. which I suppose I should have just let this go, but honestly it was extreme enough it got a reaction.  As you can see, another redditor got upset and I simply pointed out it was a joke to clarify I wasn't trying to be mean.  I'm not looking for a fight here.  However, potentially a bit harsh, I used a nazi comparison.  This was done because of the recent daily show events pointing out how the over use of the comparison to nazi's detracts from the power of the comparison and waters it down to what has almost become a daily use, thereby diluting it's meaning.  Which is why the use of the word bigot as a reaction to a joke would be offensive to someone who's lived through actual bigotry .. just as a nazi reference on fox news would probably be offensive to someone who survived the actual holocaust.  But, again, perhaps it was a bit harsh.  However, given the use of the word bigot to a 2 line joke that poked fun at a common misconception (not even an insult to the life style in general) I thought it was at least somewhat appropriate.  I think tried to make him realize that an over reaction of this sorts may be why jokes like this, as well as other negative social responses, exist in the first place.\n\nThis is where the obvious difference of opinion regarding social and cultural differences became apparent.  He began to point out that since vegetarians are outliers, jokes of this nature only reinforce negative connotations of the group.  I happen to disagree with this stance for a multitude of reasons.  For one, just because you're different and a minority doesn't make you exempt from having jokes made at your expense.  As an atheist, I'm quite aware of this (and from your user name, you are as well).  \n\nThis is where you jumped in, but I'll continue with where the above conversation went.\n\nI pointed out that comedy can be used as a tool to get people to become more comfortable with differences they don't understand and are uncomfortable with.  I used more powerful differences as a form of emphasis.  After all, if comedy can help racism and homophobia, it certainly would aid in the general acceptance of something less intrusive, such as vegetarianism. \n\nThis point was apparently lost on sylvan (whom I recall picking fights in other subreddits, and I believe I referred to him as a troll because his reactions were so over the top a few weeks back).  He then began to ask for evidence supporting my previous point, even though his evidence was the wikipedia and one page was 3 sentences long.  \n\nHe also made a very comical statement about relaxing tension through mutual respect.  Respect?  This coming from the guy who started off the conversation by calling me a bigot?  I actually did laugh out loud.\n\nAnother comment was about irrational hostility towards vegetarianism on reddit.  This may or may not exist, but I can't say I've noticed it.  Either way, he's obviously very passionate about this cause.  He's also very obviously not willing to find any humor in it, nor ease up on making gross generalizations about me and reddit, which is ironically what he's claiming I'm doing with a two line joke and why he's so angry.\n\nSo ... after reviewing this under a little more skeptical view, you're right, we're probably both in the wrong here.  I should have just not let him get under my skin with the bigotry comment, downvoted him (which I try never to do) and moved on with my life.  By reacting that aggressively to a joke on the internet, it should have been obvious that he's either a troll looking for entertainment or someone who's not going to listen to me anyway.  I mean, this is in an article where PETA drew anthropomorphic fish-cats and it's title infers insanity.  \n\nSo, in the future, I'll try to learn from this interaction.  For now, I'm done with that conversation, it's a waste of my time.  (says the guy who just wrote this novel .. oh no, a book joke, better watch out for any professional writers saying these sorts of comments only belittle the effort that goes into writing a real novel ... )  However I can say that my opinion on vegetarians is a bit more negative now.  I can honestly say in the future I'll do my best to avoid them.\n\nedit: on a side note, you had a good comment, self reflection with some skepticism is always a nice learning experience.  kudos for the interruption.  \n\nsecond edit .. sorry for the edit, just saw something interesting.  I wonder why there weren't any insults thrown at Bomb-20's way.  Was the sarcasm of his comment lost on sylvan, or did he just see me as an opportunity for an argument?  Either way, seems like quite the selective aggressive.	1296760198

&gt;It was easily 1000 feet wide.\n\nNot likely. Something 1000 feet wide at 15,000 feet would be still be a relatively large object to the observer compared to other objects in the sky. I could be wrong, but my rough estimation would be a couple of inches across. This is enormous. Your estimation of size and distance must be in error. \n\nMaybe someone else here better at math can correct me on this, but I'm more concerned with how you determine the size in the first place.\n\n&gt;a solid yellow light appeared at 25,000 feet or so ...\n\nHow do you determine altitude? Without triangulation or a relative object by which to determine distance, this is nigh on impossible. \n\nHow can you tell the difference between a small featureless object at close distance and a large featureless object at much greater distance?\n\n&gt;The next night, the same thing.\n\nUFOs are by definition a transient phenomenon. It is very unlikely, if they are genuinely anomalous, that they travel by a timetable. It would make it much easier for us to prove something if they did. \n\nAn unique plasma effect or geophysical EM phenomenon does not operate on predictable schedules either. \n\nIt is statistically unlikely that one observer will be present for remarkable anomalous phenomena on more than one occasion. If such phenomena are objectively real, they must be very rare, which makes observance rarer and very unlikely to repeatedly happen to a single individual. In such cases, it is much more likely to be a mundane cause.\n\nYou tell us that you use psychoactive substances. This is a concern because such use will alter your cognition in significant ways, effects which could last months. Interpretation of events will be altered, as you know. One's perception of what is real or what is possible is distorted, and one's personal connection to the numinous is greatly amplified. Regular use of psychedelics cannot fail to alter cognition even after the chemical effects wear off, sometimes dramatically. I am not saying that your account is untrustworthy because of this, but from experience I know that determinations based upon experiences under these conditions must be treated cautiously. \n\n\nMy advice would be to get a second witness to observe these objects, and get footage of them from something far better than a flip camera. We need steady footage that shows relative size of objects compared to landmarks or other features. If you can do this, your experience will become significant. As it is right now, it is anecdotal and problematic. 	1335348890

You can reverse the pain relieving effects of acupuncture by administering naloxone which is an opiod receptor antagonist.

No problem, but I disagree with you that with the power to destroy a whole planet - any extra-terrestrial intelligence would see that as ant-like behavior; not worth their time. And just to add to that, we do study ants closely, and have been for a long time - we study any beings on this planet (and we venture to study beings on other planets too) no matter how insignificant their "contribution" is, I think that comes with our inquisitive nature as human beings (which could be argued is just a bunch of electronic signals going on in our brain to make us be better able to perform the ultimate task of reproducing), just like astronomy or space travel comes from that very same inquisitiveness.\n\nI argue that intelligent extra-terrestrial beings would have the same kind of curiosity, its most likely one of the ways to ensure survival of the race. It is to me extremely short-sighted and narcissistic to believe that this planet, among an amount of planets that is impossible to comprehend with our brains is the ONLY place where beings have been able to travel into space.\n\nWe have the technology right now to send nuclear bombs into space that are capable of destroying whole planets, have them travel to other solar systems; it will take a lot of time but it will arrive at some point, potentially detonating and causing massive destruction. Blowing this planet to pieces would be easy, blowing up the moon would be a walk in the park - that's with the technology we have today. And to add to that bit; knowledge about radioactive material and nuclear potential has only been available to us for a nanosecond on a universal scale - we just happen to be alive in this day and age and not surprisingly (since we live for such short time) we have problems grasping these massive universal time scales.\n\nWe are far from significant in this universe, but we are also far from insignificant.	1345249910

My family vacationed to Gettysburg a few times when I was younger. I think we did the actual "Ghosts of Gettysburg" tour (I think that was the official name of it.)

Also, perhaps to accompany the tour or if you are just interested in checking things out yourself, there are a few "Ghosts of Gettysburg" books available. I want to say the author was Mark Nesbitt?

It's all conjecture of course, and a lot of the evidence was either inadvertently destroyed or simply absent, but its a subject that I find compelling.\n\nIn fact, the question never should be "who would want Kennedy dead" but "Who wouldn't want Kennedy dead?" Oswald, if he was acting alone and not by order of another party, did a deed that many many groups, including the Chicago Mafia, all wanted to do.  	1343461078

I can't cite this, unfortunately, but I'm of the understanding that plastic bottles require more carbonation of the soda, as the carbonation slowly leaks over time. I think this is the primary difference in flavor.

Thank you for your interesting insight, although I wonder how much pre-programmed music selections would have affected this particular synchronicity back in 1976, especially since the way I remember it, all of the radio stations that we were listening to, were playing different segments of "You Should Be Dancing" and then after each of the same songs ended at different times on each station they all went back to regular programming, and we noticed that none of the programming was similar, while we triple-checked the radio buttons pertaining to this phenomenal event. 	1328149503

This is not the writings of a sane person.

Because if you read the statements made by the firefighters on the scene they had reported that the building had been creaking for hours. They knew, based on their training and professional experience, that the building was so heavily damaged that it could not survive.

I got an experience that painfully illustrates this issue though. I got called once to cleanse this house of my friend's mom. They were seeing things I think it was orbs and such, and stuff was kept going missing. My friend's mom was rather concerned with a missing set of car keys she needed to quickly recover. I head down there and use some intuitive and occult techniques like giving the place a quinty eyed side ways glance. With these methods I perceived small fleeting "things" that weren't negative and nothing that would register as a ghost. I considered this in the context of both mythological and occult lore and I figured out what might need to be done.  I told her to find a shiny trinket or object that she didn't need and offer it to these "spirits" and ask out loud for the key to be returned and I left. About an hour later she called and said she found a beautiful a aquarium rock and followed my instructions with it. Being home alone for the day she was surprised to find the keys where she had left the rock about five minutes after she left that room. She also later on said that after that there was no noticeable activity like that. I know this is one of my less spectacular experiences.\n\nThere's ten thousand possible naturalistic explanations as to what happened there, and I have not notion of ever offering that story as proof of the existence of the paranormal. There's no way I could even begin to. In my positioned though sometimes all you can do is take it as it is so to speak. 	1324415409

You already called me naive over it. I don't see a point for you to argue with the naive or the gullible. So i'm saving you the trouble. \n\nAbout me giving you that NQghosthunter stuff. Yes, I wanted to make a point: multiple cameras don't matter. It doesn't give any more or less credibility to the subject as a whole. Is that more comprehensibly rephrased?\n\nYou keep saying that it's acceptable if it has multiple cameras. But at the same time you keep proving my point over and over. It completely does not matter if it is on one or two or a million. \n\nYou want a perfect video, with a perfect setup of a perfect situation of a thing that is inherently unpredictable, it is a behavior, it is accidental, it is sentient. We can't give it orders, we do not know the limits of what it can do, we have no idea when or why.\n\nAllow me to put this into context with an analogy of trying to proof a fast, shy, light fearing monkey. You are asking that we set up multiple cameras in a well lit lab, showing a monkey doing a specific task that is extremely rare for a monkey to do 'in the wild'.  Instead of accepting the circumstantial evidence of people who accidentally stumbled upon one, told stories about them, brought back fur and chewed on branches and make photos of fast moving creatures always to fast to capture clearly because they stay in the shade. And everytime such a story comes up you tell them they are delusional, they faked the bite marks, say the photos are always fuzzy and never really show anything; so these monkeys don't exist, well maybe just maybe, but until they are found you are going to say they don't.\n\nI think that pretty much sums it up. It's asking for a completely wrong kind of evidence. I'm saying that we don't know how to capture these monkeys yet let alone that we can take them into a lab to give you what you want. 	1336681739

Extremely important part of the linked study is this:\n\n&gt; The number of contrary unpublished reports that would be necessary to reduce the level of significance to chance (p &gt; 0.05) was conservatively calculated to be 87 reports.\n&gt; ... \n&gt; It is our opinion that this degree of selective reporting is unlikely to be found in all 12 laboratories, due to the time required to perform the pertinent experiments and the lack of funding available for them.\n\nI'm not gonna bother with this review because even if I went through all the studies they reference and triple checked their methodologies, there would be no guarantee that we'd get anything besides a sharpshooter's fallacy as a result.  For whatever reason, they took into account the possibility that the measly 12 labs that they reviewed hadn't reported negative data, but failed to consider the fact that any number of other groups could have neglected to publish negative data.  How many did?  We really can't know.\n\n[Very important related video featuring Ben Goldacre.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKmxL8VYy0M)	1351111367
There's a good chance we fixed climate change or fixed the ozone hole? \n\nWe certainly did a great job with the CFC ban, and the ozone layer will eventually firm up (still take decades). But we have not addressed anthropogenic climate change at all. \n\nExcess CO2 lasts a long time in the atmosphere - I saw a study that showed that even if we stopped emitting any CO2 whatsoever, levels would not start to fall until 2500, nor return to 1700 levels until 3000 AD. If we want to return the environment to normal we will have to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Not only are we not doing this, not only are we not reducing our emissions, we're actually increasing annual output, and in fact, the rate of increased output is itself increasing (not only did we make more GHGs in 2011 than 2010, but the difference between the two was larger than the difference between 09 and 10).	1335068787

There's allegedly a major UFO hot spot and all-around spooky place a few hours South of me, so I'm tempted to check it out and see just how active it really is.

Of course I agree and I do believe that is the likely explanation.  But seeing as it is the only facet of life where I have even considered that something spooky might be going on, I have been motivated to give it a further analysis.

&gt;the speed of light is not the fastest anything can travel, this will be proven in our lifetime.\n\nHow do you know this?\n\nI find it amusing that you accuse those who work within the confines of our best understanding of reality, of being unscientific. But you just assert that we'll find that the speed of light is not the fastest anything can travel, without any evidence to support this.\n\nI recommend that you read some books on the philosophy of science, "What is this thing Called Science?" is a good introduction.\n\nNext you'd say that it's unscientific to disregard claims about the invention of a perpetual motion machine.	1316991196

While there was a lot of crazy in this film, I have to say that the symbolic interpretation of The Shining is pretty interesting.  I was pretty impressed with the interpretation of Danny playing on the hexagonal floor while wearing the Apollo 11 shirt.  That's pretty transparent symbolism.  I wonder now if Kubrick knew that people thought he had faked the moon landing, then made a film that was an "admission" of it.  And even aside from the moon landing nonsense, the interpretation of the hotel as America and Kubrick representing himself as the business and creative side, and then having to destroy the creative side because he is driven crazy in the hotel, seems to have a decent case behind it.  \n\nConspiracy theorists are fun because they see too many patterns.  But for literature interpretation, that is actually a useful asset :p	1351608021

I would personally say the whole 'rule of non-interference' thing is b.s, based on a stance of logic. If they were truly non-interfering, our kind would have no knowledge of them in the first place. Why is it then that they're now so heavily embedded into western pop-culture? This leads me to conclude a few things.\n\nThey could be simply observing us the way we do with other creatures of this planet. If there is anything to abduction phenomena, then I'll point out how similar it is to our practices of zoological study. We track, tranquilize, take biological samples, measure, weigh, then either install a radio collar or an implant of some kind for tracking purposes. Are humans interested in sharing knowledge with monkeys? Not really, because they wouldn't understand most of it. I would hazard a guess that extraterrestrials may view us in the same light, otherwise they wouldn't abduct people and would have introduced themselves publically by now.\n\nI don't doubt for a moment that there likely are advanced civilizations amongst the cosmos, but maybe they have no interest in us? The information on the various humanoid species I read about constantly could all be total fabrication. I have no idea, and no way of corroborating it. It takes a leap of faith, and I'm not the type of person who operates on faith. Faith can be beneficial as a foundation for hope and directive for some people. For others it can be a catalyst for fanaticism of many forms.	1335854694
&gt;I don't see why hundreds of people need to be involved. It would only take a few people with access to off-limit areas over a long period of time.\n\nAt the risk of starting yet another long thread on the subject, no it would take much more than that. I presume you're saying a few people with enough time could secretly plant enough explosives. This fails because of the tubular frame construction of the WTC towers. The structural members were the **outer wall**, the solid bits between the windows. These structural members weren't in "off-limit areas", they were right in the freakin' **faces** of the people with the window offices, and there were, in fact, no "spaces" at all. The structural frame was distributed all around the perimeter, which would have required **hundreds** of explosive devices planted **inside walls** without any bigwig corner office guys even *once* complaining about the mess left by the drywallers and painters that would have been necessary to clean up after such a placement.\n\nIt's an ignorant argument, just like all the rest of these cockamamie conspiracy theories. 	1315498612

Ok. I was thrown off by the whole seeing a ufo in an old movie thing. Going into it already dismissing it in my mind. Then i watched it. Then i watched it a few more times. Then i imported it into final cut and zoomed in as much as i could.\n\nJust my opinion, but i think the initial assumption of a lens flair is incorrect. When you crop it, track it and slow it down, it appears to be an object in the sky that slows down like it's interacting with gravity. I also applied negative filters on it and for the most part, it looks more like an object than just a light reflecting off something. The only "lighting" aspect of it is it looks like it's an object that's reflecting it.\n\nIt's...crazy. Being a skeptic and then looking at something like this. Maybe i'm wrong and someone with better post production experience can look at it and debunk it better but if i would've just stopped at my initial reaction, i would've thought lens flair too. It took spending a little more time with it to drift away from that idea	1333579049

They gave me a lead apron and like you'd get at the dentist, but I'm pretty sure less radiation is almost always better.\n\nWill add the book to my list, but any chance of getting a tl;dr on what those risks were?

You just completely ignored the post you responded to because you don't want to believe what it's saying. \n\n&gt;WTC7 fell at free fall speed \n\nThis is an argument used for all the towers. It was debunked for the other towers, I know for sure. Although I'm honestly not sure falling at free fall proves? \n\n&gt;had evidence of thermite in the debris\n\nI'm guessing the "evidence" you're thinking of is that truthers like to point out pictures of crazy looking fire and melty looking chunks of steal. This isn't evidence. This is "this sort of looks like thermite". But even that isn't true. Check the link on thermite I posted below. \n\n&gt;Imploded on itself. \n\nAgain, if it did implode on itself, how is this evidence of controlled demolition. \n\n&gt;only steel building to ever collapse from office fires.\n\nYou ignored the above post and are ignoring obvious, blaring evidence that you've probably never seen because you've probably only investigated one side of the story. There were massive chunks taken out of WTC7. There are pictures. They knew it was coming down hours before it did. Not because they were planning to set off explosives. \n\nBut the thing I cannot wrap my head around... How do you justify the NYFD killing so many of its own men that day? What reason would they have? Why would they involve themselves in a suicidal conspiracy. Why would they ALL remain completely silent about it for a decade?\n\n\n Truthers think pretty much everyone was in on this operation. The media, the government, police, fire department, cia, fbi, congress, senate. Hundreds of thousands of people knew about this incredibly heinous plot for mass murder. And nobody objected. And nobody has stepped forward. Not the news anchors, television producers, senators, firemen... \n\nThat makes the least sense of all. \n	1314915618

And a little something extra, not worthy of its own post, but for the five people who actually read this...\n\nThere's a fabulous restaurant on the water called Schooner's Wharf. Cheap drinks, out-of-this-world food, friendly staff. After a sunset cruise with an open bar, we decide that we're too drunk/ lazy to go find something classier and stumble into this place. Talk to the waiter, he gets us even more -faced than we already are. Wife compliments him on his necklace, a piece of eight on a chain. Turns out it's from a shop just across the road, which is closed at that point. So we'll just have to come back for lunch the next day.\n\nShucks.\n\nMorning that we have to drive back up to fly out, we go in again. We eat, I drink, wife goes to shop for a necklace. I drink some more, wonder where she's got to, and go across to find her. The owner of the shop gives us a good deal on a full-sized medallion for her (marked $350, he's letting it go for $250. Is it worth it? Who knows, but I was buzzed and it made the wife happy) and convinces me to buy a small version for myself.\n\nSo we head north, stop off at No-Name Key, which had shown up in a crappy sci-fi book that I had really enjoyed. We drive down a dead-end road, stop and look around. Drive back towards the bridge, see a beautiful gate in the middle of a field. It looks like it should be in front of a beautiful mansion, except it's in the middle of a field with nothing else around it. Take some pictures, drive back to US-1, head north. We stop at a gas station so the wife can pee; as I'm waiting for her, I feel something brushing my arm under my shirt. If I had been on reddit then, I would have been looking to reap some sweet karma from /r/spiders, but instead flail and scream in a manly fashion until I figure that my new chain broke and was sliding down my arm. Look everywhere for the medallion, and it just isn't there. Look in the car, same deal.\n\nWife decides that the best course of action is to drive back to Key West to buy me another one, stopping everywhere we had previously stopped to look for the lost jewelry. We stop at every place that we had paused to take pictures, and shockingly can't find a half-inch silver disc.\n\nAnd then we get to No-Name Key. As we cross the bridge, the sun drops below the horizon. If you've never been to this out-of-the-way island, there are about twenty people who live there off the grid, and there is zero artificial illumination. And Key deer, so you have to drive slowly.\n\nWe pull over at the gate in the middle of nowhere, stop the car, and get out. There is just enough starlight to see the gate 100 yards away, and it looks creeptastic. Like something is waiting on the other side with a delightful assortment of power tools, waiting to film the latest episode of This Old Serial Killer. But we scooby around like champs, shining flashlights everywhere, looking for the glint of silver. We find neither lost coin nor vicious monster, and feeling better head to the dead-end.\n\nNow this dead end is at the end of a quarter mile straightaway, and you can just barely see the bridge from the end. So we pull right down the end, k-turn, and park. We walk slowly up and down, not wanting to get too far from the car because SPOOKY! After about ten minutes, I spot a glint from the ditch to the side of the road. Success? No, alligator! So now my wife drives slowly beside me with the door open, so I can jump in if need be, because I'm too wordy to be eaten.\n\nWe decide that it's a lost cause, and I call the jewelry shop to see if he's still open so we can just go buy another one. Successkid.jpg, he is and we can make it back before he shuts. So I hop in the car, we drive towards the bridge, and lights show up from another car across the bridge. A box truck drives over, stops right after the one-lane bridge, pretty much in the middle of the road. Brights on, pointing right at us. And there is a nasty sense that these people don't want us here. We drive as quickly as fear of killing a small deer will let us, edge past on the shoulder, and drive to the main island. As we look back, two shadows get out of the truck and just stare at us until we get out of sight.\n\nI got a new necklace, and we drove really fast back to the airport.\n\nTl;dr I saw an alligator and two guys in a box truck, none of whom wanted to point me in the direction of lost and found.	1351919228

1. This is largely factually untrue as no complete gun bans are in effect anywhere in America. It's not about personal aversion to guns, it's about a legitimate disagreement on what is best for the public interest. \n\n2. I'm not aware of many vegetarians who want to outlaw meat, but for those who do I understand. They place a much higher value on animal life, some even going so far as to say animals are equally valuable life as humans are. They think it's immoral and cruel to kill animals, so they want to ban it. Similarly, a lot of conservatives think a 4 week embryo is equal to a human life, and they want to ban abortions. "If a liberal doesn't like abortions, she doesn't get one. If a conservative doesn't like abortions, she wants all abortions outlawed." \n\n3.

It is fantastic, and a must watch for anyone interested in the war on terror.\n\n\nthe point that the documentary is making is that, whilst such terrorists obviously exist, they are a loose grouping linked by ideology, rather than an organised worldwide hierarchy with a formal structure. It goes on to argue that whilst there is a self evident problem with Islamist terror, the breadth and organisation of the groups has been exaggerated, as finding ways to scare people is an easier way to get elected than finding ways to inspire people.\n\n\nI strongly urge everyone to watch the films, even if you don't agree with the concept.\n\n\n	1343998519

Does the vaccine completely prevent integration of the virus? I'd be surprised if that were really true. My understanding is that if the virus can get into your cell, it can integrate into your dna.

Well, when alcohol was made illegal, what happened to the quality of liquor? It was either bathtub gin or Canadian whisky.

&gt; Why are there explosions in the video?\n\nReally? Did you just link me to a video claiming there were explosions in Building 7 that [even 9/11 Truthers agree is a hoax video](http://world911truth.org/fake-new-building-7-video/)? (Details of how and why this hoax was made can be found [by the person who made it here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8VAsoVuShM)). \n\nOf course, nothing you said in this comment addressed the actual point I was making about Building 7. If I were uncharitable I'd label your response with a large number of comments as a [Gish Gallop](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop), but I suspect that you aren't doing that deliberately, but are rather engaging in a very standard cognitive error where when one has some data or argument that contradicts a cherished view, rather than examine the new evidence and incorporate it into one's worldview one instead simply [repeats related cached thoughts for one's viewpoint](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/). This is a common cognitive error, deeply connected to belief overkill and [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).\n\nNow, I'm not at all sure that this conversation is worth continuing. I will briefly address some of your points, but I'm not going to substantially continue this conversation unless you indicate some minimal ability to indicate that you can admit when you are wrong (e.g. linking to a hoax video) and can actually address points made by other people (in particular, the actual problem of the motivation behind bombing building 7).\n\nWith that disclaimer out of the way: The fact that some engineers will say something or that some firefighters will say something isn't really good evidence when one considers how many firefighters and engineers there are. For example, Gerard Bouw has a PhD in astronomy and is a geocentrist. The presence of limited numbers of people with related expertise who happen to agree with contrarian views is not terribly strong evidence. \n\nThe passport thing is unlikely but not miraculous. If you do think it was so incredibly unlikely, why would the conspiracy have bothered doing that? Seems like evidetiary overkill. Also, can you explain how Kerik's later convictions have anything to do with anything other than general shit smearing? Are you claiming that Kerik was a member of the conspiracy? \n\n&gt; Why was the steel carted away immediately to be melted down in China and India instead of being examined?\n\nThis is really simple- because no one important cared, (just as no one important now) cared about the 9/11 truthers. What happened was pretty clear to almost everyone. They weren't going to keep around massive piles of steel so that it could get a detailed forensic investigation when there wasn't that much question about what had happened.\n\nRight now, you should think really hard about the fact that you fell for such a transparent hoax video. What does it say about your capability to evaluate evidence in this matter in an unbiased fashion? \n\n	1329800318

While I do also feel strongly about the subject, I think it's important to remember that logic and reasoning aren't in-born traits; everyone, everywhere has to learn how to leave the demon-haunted world for the reasonable one.

But all available evidence that suggests the universe is anything but infinite comes from the fact that we can never see outside the barrier known as the "known universe". All of our science and understanding of the space around us deals only with this known universe. Trying to use anything we know to predict the happenings of the outside is like using a metre stick to measure the amount of molecules of water in a 5 dimensional swimming pool in the south of attlantis in units of ducks/fortnight; who the fuck knows.\n\nBut what I do know is, based on our one data point, that when you mix a certain set of molecules in a certain set of conditions and let them sit for just enough time, this is what happens, all this life. And not just a little life, fucking in every crevice and niche, all over the world. you would never gather enough sticks to shake at it. And we know that it can happen in a couple billion years. Maybe faster, maybe we were faster than normal, who knows, but it can happen in this amount of time.\n\nAll the chemicals required are completely stable. The set of conditions, though elaborate to us, don't fall outside the range of what is considered extreme for this universe. It would be very odd if these conditions didn't happen elsewhere. The only reason to think otherwise is the same reason you guys keep saying, "no seriously theres like billions of stars, if not trillions, it could totally happen." Try again guys, the orders of magnitude you guys think you are off by could probably be applied as a power and you might be close. Life at this scale, is not that strange of a happening. \n\nBasically I still stand by my belief, that because we could never prove this either way, that one who does not accept the possibility of E.T. life simply doesn't yet grasp the real enormity of even the known universe, let alone beyond it.	1335061865

Ah yeah what I mean is that a .jpg image is lossy format, which means it looses quality due to the compression process (you can see this if you zoom into any high contrast part of your image).

But if the phone takes .bmp or .png which are lossless (don't loose quality) and you were converting them to .jpg to post to the web, then it would be better to post the original format.\n\nAs you've posted 2 .jpgs I assume the phone takes .jpg images by default, in which case, disregard this entire thread. 	1352709074

&gt;This is r/skeptic\n\nYes, where logic and reason are the gold standard and where Occam's Razor is sharp.  I think your posts are more appropriate for /r/conspiracy.\n\n&gt;From all your other post I assume that you are a doctor of sorts?\n&gt;Are you directly involved in the research done on diseases?\n\nYes, I'm in medicine and see patients regularly.  I not currently involved in primary research but have done some bench research in biochemistry.\n\n&gt;As a doctor do you believe that the drugs that you prescribe to a patient is the best drugs for the job? Or is it just the most cost effective drug? \n\nI'm not sure why you are implying that these are mutually exclusive. The best drug is simultaneously efficacious AND cost-effective for the patient.  In choosing a drug, I absolutely consider the patient's ability to pay.  Writing a script that the patient can't afford to fill is counter-productive.  This isn't to say that the quality of care is directly proportional to your bank account.  If we can get insurance or Medicare/Medicaid to cover it, we go with what's best.\n\n&gt;Do you not thinks that some discoveries are kept quite for the sake of profit? It is a profit driven world.\n\nQuite or quiet? English may not be your first language and that's fine but maybe something got lost in translation.  Assuming you meant quiet this is not the kind of thinking I expect on r/skeptic.  Pharmaceutical companies are absolutely profit hungry monsters but that makes them more likely to bring drugs to market, rather than less.  They will slightly alter the molecular structure of a drug so that they can re-patent it and keep prices high.  They're also far more likely to push a new drug out and obfuscate negative clinical data and pump money in to marketing than the basic science research.  Several major drug companies have all been publicly outed as having done these things within the recent past (i.e. this isn't idle speculation, but rather something you would read in a reputable newspaper).\n\nAlso, how much would I make prescribing penicillin G (low cost) versus cefepime (higher cost)? Answer: on both, I make nothing.  Doctors aren't paid for writing prescriptions.  That simply isn't how it works.  There is no kickback.	1350597857

You can't discuss evidence for or against God unless you discuss the nature of God.

With one of the kids, the epidural had worn off completely along the nerve in my right hip, and I thought that my hip would explode...but I contribute that to the pain feeling a bit more concentrated than it normally would have been.  (which may be part of why the gallstones hurt so much more)\n\nThen again, you add the episiotomy and still getting a 3rd degree laceration...\n\nI'm just glad I have a high pain tolerance.   	1329967849

You don't seem to quite understand definitions. I never said they practised neuroscience, I said they look at the brain from a structural and/or physical perspective. If they practised neuroscience then they'd be neuroscientists. I would disagree with the statement that the two are completely separate, there are areas of the two which obviously are, and that's the statement I've seen here. But there are areas (such as the plasticity area which I mentioned) which are often shared. \n\nThe categories aren't arbritrary. They denote particular sub-fields of psychology. I was hoping you'd take those and do a bit of investigation yourself into it all. I don't have the time, nor the will, to give you a full rundown of every field. But, for example, neuropsychology is largely concerned with brain functioning in regards to particular brain areas and their direct affect on behaviours. A stereotypical study would be to take an animal, lesion an area of its brain that's thought to have an effect, and run a series of behavioural tests for say... reward behaviour. You'd then obviously have control animals, and this would be done over 200 or so animals. Another thing cognitive neuro often looks at is brain anatomy and functioning in people with brain damage (the pop science version of this is Oliver Sacks book "The man who mistook his wife for a hat" which while a bit exploitative, is a good read).\n\nIn part, developmental looks at Natal development, and thus brain anatomy and differences intranatal and post. Clinical obviously takes its background from a lot of different areas, but many disorders and neurologically based (i.e Schizophrenia has both chemical elements in regards to chemical reuptake at the synapses, as does depression, and issues with information processing at different brain junctions). As a result, some clinical psychologists who are academics will focus on such areas, while others will study more behavioural aspects of therapy involved with anorexia and body dismorphia disorder for example.   \n\nMoreover, practicing psychologists, i.e clinical psychologists don't "do" neuroscience..... I don't know where to start there. Clinical psychologists that practice, run clinics, they provide therapy and treatment for individuals just like a psychiatrist.\n	1345761636

For some reason, the physical body, and its preservation (in a grave instead of cremation, no tattoos and other defilements allowed, etc) are/were very important in Christian mythology. It has to do with the pairing of the body with the soul at the Final Judgement when the world ends and the dead walk the earth and so on (or so a philosophy lecturer once told us). \n\nThere are also churches and monasteries where the bones of previous monks/nuns are preserved sort of like dog tags or a tomb stone; there's even a French (?) monastery where there are foundations, arches, walls, and even *chairs* and *tables*, made from the bones of previous residents, totally in earnest (not as some bizarre last-level-in-Doom-2 satanic mockery, but like a sculpture and testament), by a monk who lived there in the 13/14th (?) century. I think it represents a symbol of sacrifice, perhaps of people  who believed they themselves meant nothing, and were just servants to god and nothing more, but left their bones to be remembered by for the sake of record keeping, and for some practical use.	1356837286

I found no journal article that suggested it relieved pain except for possibly in the shoulder. Very sad, because I wanted it to work. I shouldn't have looked it up so I could have at least placebo'd myself.	1343972038

Back in 4th/5th grade, a friend had a ouija board and we'd use it at sleepovers (I don't remember what it said though--must not be memorable). I wanted one, and purchased my own. \n\nIt was used for the first time at a sleepover by two friends and I. All I remember is that we asked what its name was, and "it" spelled out Zoltar. We got creeped out and stopped using the board, and I still have it stored in a closet to this day, 21 years later. \n\nI recognized Zoltar as the name of the genie in the movie Big, but why that name? None of us had moved the planchette on our own.\n\n	1351787175

He knows its just mind tricks and what he wants with his video is to teach how you can be manipulated, not just by him but by anyone, especially advertisements.

&gt; what path do you think should be taken to ascend.\n\nIn the East, there are several paths laid out for personal mastery.  It is said there that there are many different doors into the house of ascension, and which one is taken is up to the individual's personal proclivities.  Much as I would like to choose the Bhakti path (emotional path of ascension and enlightenment through love), I have gotten to the point where I have found myself working more and more on the path of what is called Jnana:  ascension through knowledge.\n\nAll this is to say that while I myself have been working on personal ascension through disciplining my mind, there are as many different paths to ascension as there are beings that ascend.  Ultimately, I think it's important to try to learn as much as you can about as many things as possible while understanding that there are many frightened human beings on this planet that will fight you and your attempts at personal ascension aggressively through the use of taunts, ridicule, or worse.  It's important to listen to others well, but it's more important to really listen to yourself and what you feel is right.  Be strong and do not let others dissuade you from your path.\n\n&gt; channeled supposed "gods," really just an advanced species from beyond\n\nI would not doubt this.  I personally find it immediately invalidating whenever a being (human or otherwise) claims any level of exclusivity toward being "God".  God is literally everyone and every*thing*.  There is no "person" or being alone that is God.  God is universal and is in and of everything that ever was, is, or will/could be.\n\nAll that being said, your next statement...\n\n&gt; "preach" a message of love and shedding of personal ego.\n\nIs one that I don't think is a bad one in and of itself.  While I think it's important to be as critical and intelligent as possible, and not allow oneself to go off believing things that might not be very sound, I also think that any being truly and wholeheartedly exuding an energy of love and shedding of the personal ego is indeed a *good* being.  Now, when I say this, I stress that I mean any being that is TRULY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY doing this.  There are many - especially on this planet - that claim to be doing this that are, in fact, doing anything but.  Ultimately, the only being it seems you can be most sure is being true and good...is you yourself.  Therefore, listen to everyone respectfully and intently, but follow *no one*.  Pay attention and make sure that your *own* heart is as pure as you can make it.\n\n&gt; Positive works seem to be a common thread. Is it possible without death?\n\nIs what possible without death?  Are you asking if it's possible to exact positive works, or to spread a message of love and/or peace without death?  Perhaps I am not understanding correctly, but if this is what you're asking, then of course it is possible.  It is, in fact, *very* possible.\n\nAdditionally, we must realize that there is no such thing as death.  What humans call death is nothing more than a simple illusion wherein one's personal identity switches from one perspective to another.\n\nWhat you call life is in fact the dream that the *real* you is having.  Death is the waking from that dream.	1345593098

First let me say that you are right about: when there is no definition of a phenomenon, it's open to a wide range of speculation. However, this does not automatically mean that there is no phenomenon. That's a simple fact.\n\nSo you say, believers. Because, it is your believes that dictate what is plausible or not. In the video example that I gave, there is absolutely no proof at all that it is an insect. It means that in actuality that explanation simply falls within the range of speculation.\n\nUnless you can come up with some kind of statistical analysis of face like shapes under these conditions... it's just believes. Or at least give something. Otherwise it's simply a case of blaming 'the opposite believe' of being more gullible. Which is egoistically putting yourself on a pedestal that you made up in your own mind. (edit, not that this was your intention, It's simply very close to a 'my believes are correct and yours are false' argument.)\n\nThere is a pretty decent research paper floating around on the internet. [Here](http://www.theorbzone.com/FullOrbArticle.pdf) is a pdf. [Here](http://www.theorbzone.com/index.htm) is the website. Simply a 'everybody that has an opinion should at least read this' kind of stuff, found with a simple google search.\n\nMaking it pretty clear that in general, orbs have a natural explanations. But at the same time understanding that not every orb would necessarily be explained by this. There will be exceptions, we are talking about one.\n\nTo say that all exceptions must also be natural is astounding to me. However plausible you believe it is, there is absolutely no proof, whatsoever, in the example that I showed, that it is an insect. None. It's just your believes. At the same token, there is proof that it is supernatural, because it shows a frikkin face.\n\nIt is a perfectly valid hypothesis that when an orb has a paranormal explanation, iow, it is an entity of some kind. That it could exhibit features like a face. Which it accidentally does.\n\nAnd now you go and pretend that we are gullible, make things up and let our imagination go hay wire. That's simply not fair and simply not true. I understand perfectly well that this will not be definitive proof of some kind of paranormal explanation on its own. What it does do is show that not all orbs are simply explained away with naturalistic causes and do sometimes show abilities that might be linked to paranormal causes.\n\nIt has absolutely nothing to do with seeing what you want to see. Because 'everybody' will see that face, draw the same conclusions of what is the nose, eyes, etc. It's not open to personal powers of imagination. Go ahead, test it, [show this](http://imgur.com/LgxGX) to a 100 people and come back with a percentage. If it is so open to imagination, there will be what? 50 or 10 or 75 percent chance people see a face? And how much of them would point to the same facial features? Or is it going to be an unfair test because it is so clearly a face?\n\nOr are you backwards concluding that because people see faces in clouds, that this simply is what people want to see. Who's gullible here? Be honest.	1325574291

How could you possibly go to sleep after encountering a stranger trespassing in your house? A stranger that could just walk up the stairs and run after you?

There hasn't been a point to this conversation since its inception. I put very little effort into these discussions. \n\nAs far the rant.

I have no affiliation with either the right or the left as my beliefs and values align closest to Libertarians. \n\n&gt;Who cares about these people? They are a dwindling minority.\n\nYou and everyone else here who are constantly referring to them. \n\nAnd yes acid rain was blown so far out of proportion that the huge crisis we were in one would think would not have vanished less than a decade later.\n\n5.0 ph rain (normal) to 4.6 ph rain(acid rain) is not the end of the world.

Something bugs me about this, but I'm not sure what...it feels a bit like we're saying they are too stupid to figure out that they are being tricked.  Is that something we figured out because we are smarter?  Or because we have access to better information?  I have trouble completely letting them off the hook; they're likely smart enough folks who went to school and are able to run their own lives with some efficiency.  I would like to think they can be held responsible for their actions just as much as anyone else; we all deal with imperfect information and various forms of cultural brainwashing.

There's a pretty big 'why' associated with your assumption. Why the detail on the oval? Why the constellation pattern on the right? Why the accurate orbit lines for each planet? It would have been much easier to simply have circles in ratio size to the inner planets and circular orbits. Why not have the circle the line extends to showing a trajectory toward Earth if the point was simply to create fear in "people like me".  And let's not forget the biggest why of all... why are these patterns continuing to be made throughout the world with near zero coverage or arrests? I'd hazard a guess that it's because of people like you who have swallowed the few examples of human involvement in the production of agriglyphs and extend that proof to the entirety of their forms and don't give them a second thought.

First of all, a nitpicky point: "alumni" is plural. They want either "alum" or "alumnus."

**1**\n\n&gt; First, I would like to clarify something. I said that skeptics believe the truth where there is sufficient evidence to establish the truth and you replied with:\n\n&gt;&gt;And there is...in spades...overwhelmingly so, as a matter of fact.\n&gt;Then I mention that you think there is overwhelming evidence and you reply with:\n&gt;&gt;That is not what was said or is thought. Incorrect.\n&gt;Can you explain what I'm missing there? It looks like you're claiming there's overwhelming evidence and then saying you didn't say so.\n\nWhat you are missing is that what you, in fact, said was:\n\n&gt; I understand you *think* there is overwhelming evidence...\n\nWhile I failed to add the italics in my initially quoting you, the point is that the meaning of your statement implies that my understanding of the proof that exists is not a result of the objective reality of the phenomenon and the evidence, but, instead, based on some sort of subjective interpretation on my part.  This is why I responded then in the same manner that I am responding now:  This (i.e. how you interpreted my statement) is neither what I said nor thought.  Incorrect.\n\n&gt; What tools do you propose we use to decide what is actually true versus what is "patently false" if not (as I would recommend) skepticism and high standards of evidence?\n\nDo not use skepticism.  You must understand that skepticism, as the very definition itself says, includes (but is by no means limited to) doubting a thing *in spite* of whatever evidence may exist establishing it.  As I said before, one who does this is in no way comporting themselves critically.  They are doing nothing but parading the falsity of whatever personal agenda they have.\n\nInstead, what should be done when attempting to investigate pretty much *anything*, is simply BE CRITICAL.  This does not have to involve skepticism.  It need only involve proper analysis and REanalysis of the subject at hand...An intelligent researcher at that point simply goes wherever the evidence points regardless of how much the conclusions may challenge whatever previously held notions he or she may have.  Ultimately, skepticism is in no way necessary if and when one has a sufficiently thorough, critical commitment to the investigation of whatever subject one is dealing with.  Indeed skepticism often becomes a detriment and an anchor preventing the forward movement and acquisition of knowledge.\n\nTo be skeptical is not to be a critical analyzer.  One should never confuse one thing for the other.\n\n&gt; Surely you don't think the number of people that believe something determines what is true?\n\nIn and of itself, absolutely not.  While a comprehensive analysis of any phenomenon's validity should indeed take into account the quantitative factors involved - and while at times the ultimate arbiter of such validity hinges upon those very quantitative factors - there are other, qualitative factors that come to bear upon the final analysis and are no less significant.\n\n&gt; Please excuse me if I don't bother responding any further to the planetary conspiracy theory...\n\nThe very fact that your responses and reactions here are so predictable and controlled bode very, very ill indeed where it regards your fully arriving at a fuller understanding of the things going on around you.\n\n&gt; If the phenomenon you're talking about is the paranormal, and the truth you're aware of is that it exists, then I am disagreeing with you.\n\nOf course you are.  That much is more than apparent and obvious.\n\n&gt; I thought that was pretty clear\n\nIt is.\n\n&gt; I'm disagreeing that you have sufficient evidence to make the claim that anything paranormal exists, *regardless of whether or not it actually does.*\n\nAgain, it is obvious, of course, that you are disagreeing.  Okay.  What more do you want me to say to this?  Okay.  You are disagreeing.  Okay.  It doesn't change that the phenomenon exists and that there is ample evidence showing this...but you disagree...okay.  You can disagree that the sky is blue all day.  All I can say is okay and shrug my shoulders.\n\n[Okay](http://i.imgur.com/VwWlv.png).\n\n&gt; all I'm arguing is that you haven't met the burden of proof and you are unjustified in making that claim to knowledge.\n\nFair enough.  All I'm saying is that - as far as *anything* can be provable on this planet - you simply haven't done the research to understand that you are wrong.	1341128607
Though true, your statement is a non sequitur.	1285230349
I actually don't mind the taste, even ultrapasteurized self stable milk. I would hardly call it tasteless though. They do taste different though (to be honest I've never had raw milk so I am just talking about the difference between ultra and regular). Ultrapasteurized has a slight 'cooked' taste to it. Most "organic" style milk is ultrapasteurized.\n\nIn addition to preventing food borne illness, pasteurization also allows you to store milk longer (because you are killing of the bacteria and what not that leads to spoilage).\n\nEDIT: actually ultrapasteurized milk is not always the ultra heat treated self stable stuff, I was confusing the two. Self stable milk has the distinct "cooked" taste that I was refering too. I think most people would be hard pressed to distiguish pasteurized vs ultrapasteurized (ie most organic milk).	1317222858

You're very kind, and I've very much enjoyed listening to what you've got to say on the matter. Talking to you has helped me clarify what I really think about this matter, and has certainly given me a better perspective on the flipside. For example: while I could certainly have envisioned the elevator-man's approach as *clumsy*, I found it unthinkable that it could be considered creepy, because as I tried to point out, I can understand each decision the man made in picking the time he did, the place he did, and speaking in the manner he did. That you yourself could perceive it as 'creepy' or threatening is very useful information.\n\nI can't think of much more I'd like to go over, but I'm very grateful for the time you took, and the approach you took, and I'll keep an eye out for you around the forums here. \n\nAll the best!	1351309545
&gt;You apparently haven't spent any time in a lab. Samples get contaminated, **sometimes in the lab, sometimes before it gets there. It happens**, and that's that.\n\nBut see, you're not saying *sometimes* you are saying **always**; and that's entirely different. You are saying that it must always be happening when they perform their test. For the result to be always you'd need people to either be completely inept at their job (which would be pretty damn hard since these people have been doing their job for at least 30 years without any problems like that), or you'd need to defy the laws of probability.\n\nOr, you could simply have the more logical, more sound, and more reasonable explanation: She did her job, did not contaminate evidence, and found a new [/old] species of primate indeed does exist.\n\nOne of us is being unreasonable with our assertion and the other isn't.\n\n\n&gt;Mitochondrial DNA that is identical to human along with nuclear DNA that is novel means contamination\n\nThis is a really ignorant thing to say; How do you suppose our ancestors' DNA results would come back as?

I think that most (if not all) paranormal events are 'constructed' in a way that they can be easily debunked by skeptics, so believing in them is not forced upon people. Everybody has its own will, is free to accept its existence or not.\nImagine a husband beating his wife. If somebody saw that and told this man that he is doing wrong, he may accept it and stop or not. However imagine an aliens/ghost/whatever coming to this house and saying "YOU SHALL NOT BEAT YOUR WIFE", the man would stop beating his wife immediately because of pure fear.\n\nPeople should have their own choice whether to believe or not, and that is why paranormal events can be often explained as random coincidences.\nHope you understand what I mean ;]	1356522318

They're going to take down that working server, and infected computers won't have any access to DNS - effectively cutting them off from anything that requires address name resolution. 	1341609314

I'm sure [a library near you](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317314) has a copy. The book is expansive in its scope, so I highly recommend you read it rather than taking my summary too seriously. \n\nFirst you have to understand that Sagan was annotating and expanding Shklovskii's original book. Their contributions are clearly delineated, down to who wrote which sentence. So it's hard to capture the subtlety of that back and forth with a summary. But if memory serves, their chapter about the possibility of ancient contact between humans and an ETI is mostly or nearly all Sagan's contribution. He mostly discusses four different accounts of the Sumerian creation myth. \n\nRemember that this book came out in 1966. It was a small sensation and later became the "bible of astrobiology". The popularity of *Intelligent Life in the Universe* was Sagan's launching board into pop consciousness in America.  Although interestingly when he was denied tenure at Havard, one of their concerns was that the young scientist spent too much time talking about UFOs. \n\n*Chariot of the Gods* was written in the wake of Sagan and Shklovskii's popular work 1968. It's unfortunate that this pseduoscientific speculation sold millions of copies while Sagan's work, while popular, sold only tens of thousands. It's quite ironic that Sagan so directly inspired Von Daniken.\n\nAnyway, if you're interested in ancient astronaut theories in general there's much more in *Intelligent Life in the Universe* that you'll enjoy. It covers a lot of ground, from specific planets to comets to Phobos to UFOs to the origins of life to nucleosynthesis. Sagan's presentational flare comes through with the rich historical quotes and many pictures. And I personally think the whole collaboration aspect is extremely interesting, and I love following the different perspectives. It's hilarious how frequently Carl Sagan will rant. Whole chapters have zero additions from Shklovskii. Yet no chapter is free of Sagan's comments. Remember that originally this was Shklovskii's book! \n\n**TL,DR**\n\nCarl Sagan.	1349513732

1) Little People: "They are often described as being no more than nine inches tall, though with the physical features of a humanoid" Like a Monkey perhaps?\n\n2) Giant Birds: Described as scaly creatures with giant wings. They're probably eagles. Usually there isn't any frame or reference in the sky a cloud you think is massive may be tiny and just at a lower altitude then you thought. [Here's](http://cdn1.arkive.org/media/73/73BA077B-913A-4C2E-98A6-94BF9188275C/Presentation.Large/Immature-Stellers-sea-eagle-in-flight.jpg) a Stellers Sea Eagle in flight. Its giant giant wings that can span more then 8 feet. You'll also notice hes almost a blue color. That's so its harder for other animals to see him when hes flying. Look at his white markings in the right light its possible to mistake those for the bones in a bat (or similar creatures) wings. \n\n3) Dopplegangers: I'm going to keep this sample down to America for ease. About 300,000,000 people live in America. 84% of those people have shopped at a Walmart (255,000,000). On walmarts website there are 347 types of men's shirts available. 107 types of pants. The chance of any specific outfit of pants and shirt being bought by some one shopping for an outfit at Walmart is 0.003. That's pretty small but when you consider 255 million people shop at Walmart 3,000,000 people likely own the same pair of pants and shirt. Given this it starts to become apparent that look alikes are not that uncommon.\n\n4) Time Slips: [Dissociation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology))\n\n5)Chupacabra: Super duper awesome best cryptid.

I urge anyone compelled to refute this to stop for one moment and actually read/skim the report and see the anomalies in their bare form, in their own words and context. In parts it openly admits certain things that can only be explained by facts not pertaining to the conspiracies portrayed in the NIST report, such as WTC 7 falling unilaterally at free fall speed. This is not possible from any combination of the damage or fire sustained during the 911 attacks. I'm sure you're all sick of these posts but I'm an advocator of truth and facts and feel a need to add light to the mist of misinformation. There are plenty of facts about 911 that clash with the official story, even acknowledging one fact that doesn't correlate with the teachings in the report is enough to question the whole article. All I'm saying is there are unignorable scientific barriers with the report, nothing more than that and If you still disagree I'd like to hear why. Thanks.\n\nSeeing as this is for skeptically minded people and not raving lunatics, here are reports and testimonies from over 1500 professional architects and engineers, some world leaders in their field expressing issues with the official report.\n\n[http://www.ae911truth.org/](http://www.ae911truth.org/)	1339012469

It's not a matter of uncommon -- every single serious study I've seen on the issue has suggested that it's a non-existent connection. \n\n&gt;Subsequent research found that, while large doses of MSG given without food may elicit more symptoms than a placebo in individuals who believe that they react adversely to MSG, the frequency of the responses was low and the responses reported were inconsistent, not reproducible, and not observed when MSG was given with food.[18] No statistical association has been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people convinced that they are sensitive to it.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate#Health_concerns\n\nThe whole thing dates back to the 60s when it was postulated MSG might be responsible for "Chinese restaurant syndrome" and it's taken hold in pop culture since. The reality is there's no hard science actually backing this up. Even individuals that claim to be MSG sensitive do not reproducibly respond to controlled tests.	1294265847

As an undergrad, you don't need to understand statistics particularly well in most of your psychology classes.  In graduate school, few of the more "practical" psych degrees (counseling, social work, psy.d) require much in the way of stats either.\n\nFor those that do (various doctorates, M.S.), they're taking a bunch of students that probably had a pretty weak foundation in math going into the program.  There may also be a limited set of the faculty which understands the statistics on a fundamental level.  In my experience, many of the psychologists that do understand the stats may ignore important design/psychological considerations at the same time.\n\nI'd say you also wind up at a disadvantage when attempting to make meaningful predictive statements about specific populations.  The scope of a proper experiment investigating pathology should necessarily be fairly narrow, and often examines a specific disorder.  However, it's often nigh-impossible to get sufficiently large AND random sets of people with a very specific disorder.  \n\nFor example, your only source of PTSD patients might be from a local VA hospital.  You'd like to be able to make a meaningful statement about PTSD with your findings, but your study is accordingly crippled by both poor sample size and a very abnormal sample.  It's reasonable to think that returning soldiers would have many commonalities with respect to experience and type of PTSD (acute vs. chronic, clustering of symptoms, history prior to event, etc.).  It's not reasonable to generalize them to all PTSD sufferers.\n\nThat study may get published just the same, with a "PTSD sufferers show increased likelihood of BLANK" lede.  Were the statistics used necessarily bad?  Perhaps not.  However, a second researcher comes along later and throws that study in with others in a meta-analysis of PTSD studies (not distinguishing that it doesn't say much about the disorder as a whole).  The result is the inclusion of questionable data in a paper that makes more general claims about the disorder.  Papers like the meta-analysis are more likely to inform prevailing opinions going forward.\n\nThe inconsistency of understanding of facets of design, statistics, and pathology is what I see as the more general problem facing the field at the moment.	1337957974

&gt;Putin had the dude silenced.\n\nDon't be so quick to jump to that. It was a very sloppy way to kill someone, seeing how the KGB has killed people in very creative ways, (including using a ricin tablet inside of an umbrella, which the agent nicked the target with while walking past him), it would be a very strange way for the Russian government to go about killing someone. His death also did more harm than good to the Russian government. Litvinenko had been going public with all kinds of information for a long time, he wrote two books during his time in Britain, some people have even said that he was running out of money because he ran out of stories to market, and there are no signs of any assassination attempts while he was writing those books. \n\nThis guy was not a high level agent at all, the US even denied him asylum, apparently the State Department didn't think he wasn't worth dealing with. \n\nYes, you do need to be very wealthy and powerful to get a hold of enough polonium-210 to kill someone, but there were many other wealthy and powerful people who would like to have seen Litvinenko dead. Traces of polonium-210 were found in Berezovsky's office, and Russian prosecutors were blocked from questioning him or searching his office. Litvinenko also wrote a lot about the Russian government's involvement with organized crime, and Russian gangs certainly have enough wealth and power to get a hold of some polonium-210. \n\nIntelligence agencies tend to act intelligently, and assassinations tend to only be performed when it directly benefits the state or those in power. This was not a very intelligent attack, which leads many to think that it was done by a gang or a guy with shitloads of money and a vendetta against Putin. 	1356636968

&gt;A UFO could be anything. I'm not going to say you're lying if you say you saw one. But if you try to claim it's something extraterrestrial or paranormal, I'm going to ask for proof.\n\nClearly this would be impossible.  If you saw a UFO that you thought was of extraterrestrial origin, how would you prove to someone like yourself that it was indeed extraterrestrial?  What if 10,000 people saw a craft 10 miles long glide over their neighborhood, everyone took pictures and video etc etc. Even that isn't proof that it's extraterrestrial. It's good that you're skeptical, but the "proof" you require would be impossible for any observer to obtain. 	1341125432

I am vegan and have experienced varied reactions firsthand.\n\nTypically, when people confront me or ask about being vegan I point out that studies show that veganism can be healthy. So choosing not to be vegan is an ethical choice where you are weighing animal interests and environmental consequences against your own pleasure and convenience. That's normally seen as pretty reasonable, so I don't get too much attitude (unless I'm on the internet), but I do get some rude dismissals.\n\nI think people have a prototypical vegan in their minds who is some sort of new age hippie. So, for the skeptic community, there's going to be some resistance. Throw in some trumped up claims of dietary perfection and you've got reasons for skeptics to be turned off from both sides.\n\nLike all communities, there are vegans who could use some education. I used to talk about the China Study a lot, until someone pointed out the problems to me. Now, I use evidence about how being vegan can be healthy, but never present it as some miracle diet.\n\nLike the vegan community, I think the skeptic community would do well to check out some people that talk about the ethics of animal use without involving bad science or hippie stuff. [Gary Francione](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Animal-Rights-Your-Child/dp/1566396921) is a good example of one of those people.\n\nSo, I didn't really answer the question yet. I do think it's unreasonable how some vegans are treated, but the vegans who are in to good science and good ethics need to be better at messaging and speaking out. The skeptic community should see people who are being misled by bad information as people that need to be informed, not mocked and dismissed. Additionally, I think people who are interested in rational inquiry and truth seeking, should look into the legitimate reasons for being vegan instead of dismissing the whole idea because they've ran into some vegans that they didn't like.\n\nIn my experience, there are a lot of omnivores that don't like being called out for their lifestyle choices. Even when I'm not discussing being vegan with someone, just existing around them can be accidentally confrontational. Most people don't want to hurt animals, but they've been taught and reinforced to themselves that it's necessary or it's okay. By existing as a vegan, I point out that it's not necessary and I don't think it's okay to use animals. People have a bad reaction to having that thrown into the light because most people want to believe they are good people who would not hurt animals unless it was necessary.	1343746239

That's true, but Ockham's Razor is about what you should *assume*. \n\nFor example, there is no principle in science which states that ghosts can't exist or that they aren't real. However, when presented with a "ghostly" event, in order to conclude the presence of a ghost, you would have to assume a large amount of new information. Ockham's Razor simply states that if you don't know the answer to something for sure, you have to assume whatever posits the least amount of new information. Obviously those assumptions can be wrong, but they're usually correct because of the law of probability. The more variables you add to a possible outcome, the more the odds of it being the case decrease.	1326616417

It wasn't having my beliefs being coddled.  It was being challenged in a way that gave my beliefs the respect of being answered. \n\nOn the other hand, that's the long way around.  My point is that it is generally easier to remove the barriers to the evidence than trying to overflood it. (Which requires a mind willing to carefully consider evidence as it is rather than as what their preconceptions demand it be.)	1265519968

No problemo! I just didn't want to devote an hour to gathering up all the resources so you could verify what I would be saying (esp. since I'm supposed to be studying).\n\nOne thing occurs to me, and it's relatively easy to explain, as I look back over the list... there have been several studies investigating the creeping age of menarche (first period for women, marks the onset of puberty in females). The proposed link seems to be between BMI and menarche - higher BMI at a younger age -&gt; earlier menarche. In fact, when I first learned about menarche, it was thought that women needed to weigh a certain amount (this does not appear to be the case, but the 'rule of thumb' still applies). The magic figure used to be around 105lb (47kg), IIRC.\n\n[This PDF](http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jobes/2011/180729.pdf) is one example of evidence in favor of a correlation between increased BMI and earlier onset of menarche. In a (health) nutrition class I took just recently, one group presented on the increasing age of menarche in certain schools in Hong Kong as being indicative of the veracity of the BMI-menarche link. \n\nI could go on, but I assume you have a few tidbits to tear somebody a new one with! Good luck!	1312775670

A pretty basic one would be having a causative mechanism - that is, knowing how A might cause B. If you have a plausible causative mechanism and a correlation, you can then use the causative mechanism to work out predictions that can be made to test the mechanism.\n\nIf your predictions fail, your causative mechanism is disproved. If your predictions come true, you have more confidence in your mechanism and develop further predictions, then repeat as necessary.\n	1355406153

No worries, I don't mind skepticism!  There's a decent amount of discussion of this in the perpetual motion machine debunking literature/community, and here are a couple representative sites I found from googling:\n\n[Link 1](http://reedmagneticmotor.com/)\n[Link 2] (http://dispatchesfromthefuture.com/2007/07/first_glimpse_of_an_orbo.html)\n\nTo think of this in an easier way, imagine wrapping a coil around a permanent magnet. Then heat the magnet, and as the magnetic domains randomly realign and destroy the net magnetic moment of the bulk, the change in flux will induce a current in the coil.  But that's not FREE energy!  It was "stored" in the magnet because the parallel magnetic domains were in a higher energy state than the state where they cancel each other out, which become accessible as their thermal energy increases.\n\nThat's functionally similar to what magnetic motors seek to accomplish.\n\n	1348468547

None of his hypothesis have been experimentally disproven. We've never actually played with heavier elements that are stable.

&gt;If they were studying us, then the best way to do so would be with the least amount of interference possible. This way they can observe us in our natural habitat and our natural behaviors. Flying around in front of some random Joe Schmoe iPhone user is not exactly "least amount of interference."\n\nI disagree again. Interaction with the object of study is valid way of learning about it. Have you ever read Jacques Vallee? He had the idea of UFOs as being part of a "control system" - basically an extended cosmic ecology of which we are a part, but which is ultimately beyond our complete comprehension just by virtue of our anatomical and cognitive limitations.\n\nThe analogy would be fish in the ocean. They think the ocean is "it." We know it isn't. And sure, we observe them "with as little interference as possible," but sometimes we do interfere. 	1349339838

The only decent paranormal show in my opinion is "My Ghost Story" since they actually show the evidence, pics, videos, EVPs, along with the witness story. Celebrity Ghost Stories is entertaining, and has some credibility since I doubt most celebrities would risk ridicule talking about things like that, but without evidence it's still just stories. The rest is bullshit though, I can't stand any of the other shows. That one ghost show with Zack whats-his-name, assuming they aren't hoaxers, seem to have gotten some good stuff over the years, but they still make a big deal about nothing most of the time. I generally disregard any network paranormal show since there is no telling if they make shit up just for ratings. Would be nice if there was an actual scientific show about the paranormal, but I doubt that would ever happen.	1327565553

..part 1\n\n&gt; Sorry about the length :)\n\nNo need to apologize, I was looking forward to a point by point reply :)\n\nBut because of your need to apologize, I'm assuming it might be a reflection on how you think about these long responses so now I feel the need to apologize.. sorry about the length!\n\n&gt; I should probably clarify exactly what my view is before I get into my points though. My view is that this would be a great way to live if it worked, but there are too many unknowns at present to say whether it's feasible. \n\nIt's true, there are a lot of unknowns, but on the other hand, there is also a lot of data pointing a certain way. And let's not forget the learning experience, it would be a huge opportunity whether it succeeds or not to put some theories (as theoretical as the theory of evolution or gravity) about human behavior to the test.\n\nBut I'm pretty optimistic, I admit, about the positive outcome this could have for humanity and the feasibility of a working RBE. (Otherwise I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now, obviously)\n\n&gt; These include:\nWhether people can be educated to live a life free of waste, and to share resources instead of hoarding them.\n\nBefore I reply to this I do want to state that I'm going to share my personal views and it might not be official RBE material but I don't think it matters, I generally think more in line of directions and using wide guidelines to achieve a RBE-type system.\n\nI do know that the TZM-collective doesn't see the arrival of a RBE at the end of the year or decennia. We're looking at it like how cathedrals were built, it took a few generations.\n\nSo with that in mind, it's not about if it is possible to turn around people today (though that could work for the most part I assume, and we're already doing this by exposing people to this information) but it's generational thing, the education and environment of the children (think of the children! :)).\n\nI have met a surprisingly growing number of people that tell me that our system will eventually change itself to a RBE, and that there is no real need for what TZM does. The argument is that as we are constantly improving our environment that this gradual change would finally arrive at a RBE after a few (when we're long dead and burried) generations. But I'm not that much of an optimist and I would rather "take matter into my own hands", I'll probably never know the outcome but I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't do anything about it today.\n\nBut to answer more specifically, education can change people so they live a life free of waste (or keep it in mind and motivate them to do something about it) and share resources instead of hoarding them. Education would make it clear to them that it is in their personal interest to behave that way. And what benefits them (a more clean, healthy environment, less crime) benefits others automatically.\n\n&gt; Whether the leaders of countries can learn to share resources (though this and my previous point are probably intertwined).\n\nI guess I can refer to my previous reply.. it would be beneficial for themselves as well.\n\n&gt; Whether all the resources we need can be obtained in some form (whether through recycling, growing, synthesising or some other means) - the technology to do this efficiently doesn't exist, and in fact some resources can't be recovered at all (I'll expand on this later in this post).\n\nI know my answer is only based on speculation, but I tend to think it is credible.\n\nIt's all about intelligent management. There are today already alternatives to certain resources, and I don't mean exact replacements, we might have to do with less so we can do more. And I'll exaggerate with my example but you'll get the point, maybe instead of a solid gold chain you could have a gold plated chain (with comparable weight/feel). Not that people would actually want a gold chain in a RBE, this is just an exaggeration :)\n\n&gt; So, yes, if we could get rid of capitalism, things may improve, but it depends on what it's replaced with, and whether that system works for the benefit of the people. And the last large societal experiment of that ilk (Soviet Russia, and Communism in general) didn't turn out too well for the people in those countries as well as other countries, so perhaps we can see one of the reasons for reluctance to change.\n\nI get this. And I wonder how that experiment would've looked if there was no money involved and equal access. Those are 2 components that have a very big impact on any system. Would it have failed as much? Would it have failed at all? I don't know, but it's food for thought.\n\n&gt; The major thing I'm trying to get across is, before we can state that an RBE is indeed superior, we would need to run an experiment, and I believe that's one of the things TVP advocate.\n\nWell, what TVP actually wants is to build a test city first for researchers, to map the worlds resources and all other details about this planet relevant to how it can be applied to a running social system. This information is vital for the goals of a RBE.\n\n&gt; We cannot, at this point, say that it will work, but we can point out some of the potential pitfalls. It's hard to say whether the issues can be resolved right now.\n\nI agree completely. And you might have already distilled my view on this, it's not because we don't know the outcome beforehand that we shouldn't at least try it. Eyes on the prize, and its a very attractive prize (world peace, comfortable lives, equal opportunities, no slavery (payed/unpayed) or prostitution (of any kind)).\n\n&gt; True, but there are resources we require that cannot be recovered - when they're used, they're gone.\n\nWell, I was only making the assumption, just as I'm assuming that there could be a way, one day, to maybe either regenerate or recreate. \nThere are some things we can say never on but others, like these, were we can never really say never.\n\n&gt; Also, most metals cannot be entirely recovered through recycling, despite best efforts of the companies that do it (and since they resell the recovered metals at profit, it's in their interests to maximise the quantities).\n\nUnless it costs more to do a complete recovery :) If you can't make any money by solving the problem, why solve it? That's the profit motive for ya ;)\n\n&gt; No processes are 100% efficient, and there are losses through time (the amount depending on the metal).\n\nIdd, and you are talking about down-cycling, but there is also such a thing as up-cycling. I do think that it might be difficult recycling metal alloys back to their original components for example, but I don't think it's impossible (if we're changing things at the molecular level for example). And I'm referring to my previous reply, it might not always be cost-efficient (as in, it might cost too much money than you'll get back from that "investment") to do this.\n\n&gt; Granted, part of this is through the design of the products, but there is a tradeoff between how practical it is to design a fully functional product and how much of it can be recycled - there will always be a certain amount of waste (in electronics, particularly).\n\nTrue, it might make things more complex if you have to also keep in mind the recycling part of a product. But if we're not living in a system where you only have a certain budget/time (to market, being faster than your competitor) for R&amp;D and need to cut corners to make it, things will look very different.\n\nAlso, in a RBE, collaboration would be to the benefit of this facet of product design. Instead of having thousands of different corporations with their own R&amp;D and patents, having a world collaboration of all those minds.. imagine the possibilities, it's easy to see the potential benefit(s) in this.. like for example the learning opportunities!	1317802524

It's been awhile since the DDT drama but it's important to keep yourself open to fact checking.  Bug Girl has a very good [collection and summary](http://membracid.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/brian-dunnings-ddt-fail/) of what Dunning got wrong in his podcast on DDT.  \n\nIf you weren't aware, Dunning is a libertarian and in his podcast he made several erroneous claims about environmentalists in general and Rachel Carson (whose 1962 book was instrumental in the banning of DDT) in particular.  \n\nHe has an agenda.  His podcast is usually pretty interesting but you should keep his ideology in mind when you listen.  	1339891906
Don't presume that lefties aren't a rational and often skeptical bunch. Even those of us who don't embrace nuclear power or GM cropping. (Gasp!) It wasn't that long ago that such qualities might even have been described as an identifying characteristic of left leaning folk, and plenty of us have found good reason not to drink the postmodernist cool-aid! \n\nBe honest and be respectful, and you'll be right. You might be surprised at how many people will appreciate your vocalizing doubts and reservations that occurred to them as well.\n\nGood luck mate!	1318426611

in the opinion of this atheist: needlessly antagonistic and dumb, like most of their publicity stunts.\n\nedit: also\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;“The cheapest form of pride however is national pride. For it betrays in the one thus afflicted the lack of individual qualities of which he could be proud, while he would not otherwise reach for what he shares with so many millions. He who possesses significant personal merits will rather recognise the defects of his own nation, as he has them constantly before his eyes, most clearly. But that poor beggar who has nothing in the world of which he can be proud, latches onto the last means of being proud, the nation to which he belongs to. Thus he recovers and is now in gratitude ready to defend with hands and feet all errors and follies which are its own.”-Arthur Schopenhauer	1341370636

Dr Bronner, wasn't really a Dr. but he was a great soap maker. He came to America after fleeing the Nazis. He tried to convince his parents to come with him but they thought he was being paranoid. In America he received a heavily censored letter from his father that the only readable part said "you were right". His parents were later confirmed murdered by the Nazis. \n\nIts easy to understand how that could break someone's brain a little. Anyway the company is run by his family now. The labels are a tribute to Dr. Bronner and not so much about promoting any religious belief. \n\nThe soap is magic in being damn good.

&gt; The idea is that fructose is worse than glucose since it metabolizes differently in the body.\n\nThe other way around, fructose produces a lower glucose response, and thus is 'slightly' better in terms of risk of diabetes, damage to diabetics, or for those trying to lower their weight than glucose (assuming an equal amount being compared).\n\nThere again, HFCS isn't particularly high in fructose compared to table sugar anyway.\n\nThe problem with HFCS is that it's cheap, and you can stick loads of it in a product to make it taste sweet, and people love sweet stuff so they buy more of it, and so on.\n\n\nSource: my dietician - I'm diabetic and on a 'as low as possible GI diet', pure fructose (ie fruit) is considered a low GI/GD food stuff, and thus 'ok' for diabetics to eat without too much concern, HFCS and table sugar are considered equally bad on the GI/GD scale.	1354290674

Here in NJ, I don't think the teaching is to blame at all.  I think we have some of the best, most passionate teachers you'll find anywhere.  But a big part of the problem lies in the administration at the schools.  Teachers are pressured to pass every student, regardless of how the student is actually performing.  Parents pressure the school administrators to pass their child, because they don't want their precious little snowflake to experience the "unfathomable psychological damage" caused by being held back a grade.	1295443460
&gt;nothing to back it up.\n\nNothing to back it up? Brother, if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck - it's probably a duck. (ie- there are hundreds of videos showing side by side comparisons of Bldg 7 falling at the same speed of officially confirmed bldg collapses.) Couple that with how the center of the building collapses fractions of a seconds before - again - like a common building collapse.  Finally, there are the squibs up the sides of the top of the bldg.\n\nBut yes, you'd be right in then saying that that wouldn't be evidence enough (even though it's very damming and should certainly make one think twice.)\n\nHere's a detailed analysis citing the evidence for a free fall collapse, per your request:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVCDpL4Ax7I\n\nAnd as for those pages you submitted re: collapses - they focus on Bldg's 1 and 2, but not on Bldg 7.

&gt;She genuinely meant were were supposed to be vegetarians and that meat eating was indeed an outlier, or aberration, that would (and should) eventually be eradicated.\n\nWhile it is quite clear to me that humans evolved to opportunistically take advantage of whatever food source happened to be available (including other animals), I have to agree with your acquaintance that meat-eating ought to be eventually eradicated. There are plenty of options for obtaining full nutrition without resorting to terminating the consciousness of sentient beings, not to mention the tremendous waste of resources and environmental degradation large-scale meat consumption entails.	1297477208
In theory, labeling food GM or non-GM sounds great but in practice it would require the FDA (or the state equivalent) to allocate time and resources into investigating every food item and drug on the market. It would also mean plenty of legal proceedings because a GM label would be looked upon as a liability by corporations (who would go to court to have re-evaluated or removed). It would mean a large increase in government spending with absolutely no useful or positive benefits for anyone except to ease the minds of a very small group of people. \n\nDue to our (US) current economic situation, an increase in spending in one area means spending cuts in other areas (most likely from education, grants, and scientific research). It would be a gross misuse of our limited time and resources. 	1345051302

Do you make sure to examine your own arguments?\n\nI consider myself an ardent skeptic, but I have been admirably argued against for the benefits of homeopathy (placebo effects, hope - wether false or not). This part of your post looks like you have whipped your cohort into a fervor:\n\n&gt;They simply couldn’t believe that anybody could believe in something so stupid. We spent a couple of weeks on this topic with students asking why the government hasn’t stepped in to stop them and what can we do to educate people about it.\n\nMight you consider that you only presented one side of this argument? I have no doubt that homeopathy is not a science but it is also interesting to consider it's societal implications. Perhaps hosting a debate with a local advocate of homeopathy would enable your group to come to a more informed view point. \n\nJust a thought. Congratulations on promoting skepticism so effectively.

Well, if we could simulate worlds I think we would be doing it - there's quite a bit you can learn from that. (Remember: the best way we're going to have to learn more about how the human brain works, is to simulate it with the models we have, see how the results compare to reality, and adjust the models accordingly. We can't just open people's head to see what's happening inside - so simulations will be widespread for research purposes once they become feasible; not counting the fact that you might want to simulate what a drug is going to do to you before you actually take it, and so on.)\n\nSo the opposite assumption - that it is possible to do such simulations but almost nobody is doing them - seems very implausible.\n\nNote that all this does not make the argument solid. We have no proof of other civilizations yet - it's safe to assume there are many, but we don't know. We also have no proof that a large fraction of existing civilizations would be capable of such a simulation - it might very well be that it takes so many resources that it is only worth doing it at a very small scale even if you have the technology for it; but a small scale simulation would probably not fit the definition of "simulated world". And so on...\n\nStill, the chance of being inside a simulation is non-zero, and I can understand why some people think it is very high, so it's an interesting issue from a philosophical point of view (not really from a scientific point of view).	1299723938

I disagree. I think there is more than enough evidence to conclude not of this world life forms. I would go as far as to say that most life forms here came from out there. Almost zero came from here in the beginning, IMO. \n\nAlso, they are not coming here just to do "fly bys". There is a reason(s) they are here and have been here. \n\nCrop circles being one proof for me of visitations of INTELLIGENT extra terrestrial visitations. Even if they send a remote robot to create the crop circle, that is in essence a visit from an intelligent extra terrestrial being just as we do with the mars pathfinders. \n\nStill no one can explain the pyramids or the rock work in Peru. There are probably many, many other unexplainable places on earth that were clearly not made by man and the machines/tools that man could build by themselves. \n\nThis is were I don't understand non believers, how they cannot believe. \n\nDid you see the flute they found recently, about 42,000 years old plus or minus?

That's a slippery slope, and one that my girlfriend is addressing in for her Masters in Public Health thesis.  It's about how to address the anti-vaccine problem in general, as well as how to provide access and education for the vaccines.  This issue is a big one because it requires *coercion*, which is arguably unethical (this debate is raging), despite being in the interest of the greater good/world at large/entire population.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of unintended consequences that would come along with this proposed law, such as poor people being arrested for simply not having access to proper medical care (either through lack of funding, physical proximity, time off work to get your kids to the doctor, etc).  I'm not saying you're wrong (or right for that matter), but there are many more layers to the issue than such a law can fix, and ultimately it could do more harm than good to make vaccines mandatory by law...could being the operative word there, which is why the experts are still debating.	1328823782

But how can you possibly perform a fake chiropractic manipulation? Doing them wrong can cause serious injury, and you can't blind the individuals performing the manipulation because they'll know if they're doing it right or not. It's not like you can train a non-chiropractor to perform these manipulations - they take hundreds of hours of study to master.\n\nAlso just as an aside, chiropody is an [antiquated term for podiatry](http://www.google.com/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=chiropody#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;q=define:+chiropody&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=define:+chiropody&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=330114l330815l0l331080l8l5l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&amp;fp=4843294771223d1e&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955), and isn't related to chiropractic (not trying to be nit-picky - I'd actually never seen the word before, myself, so I went and looked it up!).	1316401067

It was never about the math or the science, I think. The pundits are employed by the media, and the media needs viewers and readers. How do they get it? By creating suspense. And what's more suspenseful that a "razor tight" race between two candidates _exactly_ equally likely to win?\n\n...Only, that was never the case. As Silver's models showed, the popular vote might have been somewhat close, but Obama's win was not a "toss-up" in any way at all. In fact, it was rather likely. It's just that "it's rather likely that Obama will win" doesn't create an exciting, suspenseful narrative, and the media has _nothing_ to gain by representing it truthfully.\n\nThe job of the media, that we as viewers and readers have given it, is merely to entertain is. It chooses its numbers to that end. Silver's job is to accurately represent the outcome of the election, and he chose _his_ numbers to that end. Both, ironically, succeeded at their job. People tuned in to the news and read the election blogs like crazy, and Silver got 50 out of 50 states right.	1352300727

I'm not arguing validity, that's irrelevant.  I'm arguing that the effects of one are more advantageous to the general population than the other.

Hi Aohus, thanks for the response. I haven't checked that Wiki for quite some time and I'm always reluctant to use it as a reliable source. That said, it's good to see a reference for the above quote ( Fuller, Curtis (1980). Proceedings of the First International UFO Congress. New York: Warner Books. pp. 157–163), so thanks for the pointer. I've actually been trying to find a copy of that online for quite some time, but to no avail. \n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted that which I responded to:\n\n&gt; The UFOs are ultra-terrestrial, as posed by Dr. Jacques Vallee (Stanford Research Institute) and Hynek, among others, meaning these entities are native to this planet, potentially before even mankind.\n\nAre you of the position that Hynek adheres to the ultra-terrestrial hypothesis? My interpretation of Hynek's position (on which there has been much debate) is that he acknowledged there being evidence for a multitude of potential explanations (including EDI and ETI) but, unlike Vallee, didn't ever (at least publicly) favour one over another. \n\ntl;dr: Hynek may have entertained the ultra-terrestrial hypothesis but, this was one potential explanation among many.	1333095616

I'm a Physics grad and I know a great deal about what we don't know.  I know that there are many instances of scientific discoveries being accidental, in that the measured effect was not what was intended, but without making the initial erroneous prediction and testing it the discovery would not have been made, and that this doesn't equate to the discoverers "pulling something out of their asses" and does not indicate Alien intervention.\n\nYou are taking a cowardly and circular route in this exchange by proposing something rather ridiculous, then, as a defense to my argument against the statement, saying that you don't believe the statement to be true, just that it's possible and that I can't prove it's not, so what right do I have to say what's true?\n\nWithout actually addressing my argument or the contradiction it shows in your own argument, you then revert back to reaffirming your original statement bolstered by the mantras that truth is relative, nothing is absolute, and the inability to prove non-existence allows the set of possible but extremely improbable events to have an equal claim to reality.\n\nLater.\n\n	1329011112

&gt; Pure garbage.\n\nDid you read the entire book or simply the last chapter? Also, you do realise that the link is 2 books in 1? See my comment below (with bold type). This is one of the reasons I posted a link to it and hoped to prompt discussion. That last chapter you referred to (along with two others) didn't exist when the book was first published. Indeed, when the book was published in 1956, Ruppelt concluded, "Maybe the earth is being visited by interplanetary spaceships. Only time will tell."\n\n&gt; Hynek started a real investigation into UFOs after Project Blue Book was shut down. Google it.\n\nI'm very familiar with Hynek's work. If you want to contribute by directing to a particular link, feel free.\n\n&gt; Remember, this report was published in 1956 and since then we know that government reporting on UFOs was falsified. Yes, this is a report devoted solely towards misinforming the public.\n\nNo, it was *first* published in 1956, then *republished with significant alterations and a different conclusion* in 1960. I posted this because it's *free* and would be of interest to some (whether or not they believe the contents to be garbage). Others, rather than labelling the book*s* as 'pure garbage' might acknowledge that the books have historical merit and, furthermore, question why the books have different conclusions. Don't you find that interesting?\n\n	1315156500

The second quote is misleading at best.  OP links to a video where Cooper does claim to have seen what he believes to be "non-earthly" technology.  He wasn't in space, so adding that distinction at the end allows Sheaffer to pretend Cooper claimed nothing while still being technically correct.\n\nThat said, I think it's far more likely that what Gordon saw was experimental aircraft that he simply wasn't allowed to know about.	1332245091
Yah sorry I got so excited haha. I don't know just googling around. The term phantom vibrations and a few other things have turned up. It's a debate as to whether it's by chance or by unintentional behavioral training.

Eventually ring the bell, dog drools. Sense change in electric field, phone rings, pull phone out...would theoretically change into, sense change in electric field, pull phone out, before it rings.

I do wonder about that if it were a single light, but my theory is the lights actually don't play the same role as conventional craft (landing lights etc.)\n\nI am starting to think perhaps the lights serve another purpose, maybe for travel, maybe for navigation, or maybe for becoming hidden (optical illusion to trick the mind into thinking the craft is not there)\n\nPerhaps even, when the light patterns change by either slowing down or speeding up is when we are able to see them.	1344542810

Like I said in another comment, the zoo theory is the best. With aggressiveness and other things ruled out, I think we can assume they're here( I'm just humoring BTW, I don't actually believe they're here) to condition us as a species and make sure we don't kill ourselves. \n\nI cringe everytime there's a conversation about aliens and someone blurts out the same phrase copy and pasted "they look at us like ants on an anthill " or "like how a national geographic cameraman looks at animals". No. Those terms are entirely too simple to sum up a civilization like ours. Comparing the oh so interesting nature of monkeys flinging shit at each other to a group of people 6billion strong that accomplished space flight, nuclear programs, religion and the ability to shape the world we are in today, it's totally different. \n\nIf there were aliens visiting us there's no doubt they'd find us interesting. We're not simple creatures. And like UFO believers believe, if they're really shutting down nuclear missiles, it shows good intentions. It also shows they know our history. Who we are. What our intentions are and the horrible people we can be. \n\nI always like to preface things like this with "if aliens were real ", but if they were, they feel emotions too. Just because they have space ships and better tech, doesn't mean they look at us as ants. And it doesn't mean they're evil and want to conquer us without a second thought. 	1317692393

Labeling yourself as a skeptic doesn't make you one. I'm not necessarily saying that you are not a skeptic, but if you hold faith based beliefs, you're failing to think critically in at least one area.	1323576368
In my opinion everything should be under the category: "Sounds like something to be skeptical of" to a lesser or grater degree but never 0 skepticism. Scientific results included.\n\nI'm assuming you view this as something to be more or much more skeptical off than the average for other claims. Why is this?\n\nIntelligence isn't something easily defined and it depends on the context. For example in a social situation can drinking a small amount of alcohol make you more intelligent? One view would be that by dis-inhibiting you it allows what FIXED intelligence you already have to shine but you could just say it temporarily increases a certain kind of intelligence.\n\nSo why is it hard to believe that a list of plants and plant derived drugs  can have positive effects on the average psyche? Those plants are probably drugs too but big pharma hasn't gotten around to "improving" and patenting them so you can feel safer about spending money on risky brain chemistry alteration. (OMG DRUGS!)	1353697256

The theory is that if you travel faster than the speed of light, you will go back in time, correct?  I have always wondered: If a ship leaves from one planet traveling faster than the speed of light, would it somehow compress the time it takes them to get from one point to another to make it seem like instant travel?  Even to the travelers?  There is much to be asked about time dilation and perception.	1336428805
The thing that worries me about this subreddit is they seem quite selective about what to be skeptical about. Materialism seems to be the accepted dogma, and this doesn't sound very skeptical to me. I hear people dismiss things like the placebo effect without acknowledging what an important effect this can be for some people; the idea that because we aren’t able to explain it using materialist logic it can’t be that important. I personally feel that a skeptic should be somebody who questions everything - including science. 	1328241608

Well I can't really see the point of this article, it's like saying that skepticism doesn't have anything to do with global warming because it can't answer the question "should we care about global warming?":\n\n&gt;“feminism is simply the belief that women should be treated as fairly as men.” [...]\n\n&gt;The inclusion of the word “should” makes it impossible for evidence to confirm Feminism through the process of skepticism.\n\nThat definition of feminism is simply derived from the social dogma that all persons are "equal". This is a social construct and doesn't have anything to do with skepticism like any other motivation in the world. **Skepticism can never give you a main motivation in any aspect, it can only question derived motivations to see if they are working in accord to your main motivation.**\n\nSo in this case, applying skepticism to feminism is not about asking "should women be treated as fairly as men?", that's the goal and doesn't have anything to do with skepticism like any other goal. The questions may be something like "is women treated as fairly as men?", "does process X cause inequality between women and men?", "can inequality be palliated by process Y?".	1345502676

Naturally occuring calcium fluoride/fluorite is different than the fluoride chemicals and byproducts that are added to water (often sodium fluoride, fluorosilicic acid, sodium fluorosilicate). \n\n\n[In 2006 The USGS Mineral Resources program cites that](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/fluorspar/fluormcs07.pdf)\n&gt;There was little or no domestic mining of fluorspar in 2006. Some byproduct calcium fluoride was recovered from industrial waste streams, although data are not available on exact quantities. Material purchased from the National Defense Stockpile or imported was screened and dried for resale to customers.\n\n\n([I'm sure you know, fluorite is used to prepare uranium for nuclear fuel-rods and nuclear weapons...](http://mineralofthemonthclub.org/2007-10%20Fluorite3.pdf))\n\nScreened for what exactly? Industrial waste and radiation obviously.\n\nWhat is the limit on contaminants?\n\nWhere is the oversight? How do we know exactly what chemical is used, the purity, and where it was sourced from? Who is making money from selling these chemicals to municipalities?\n \nIt all sounds a little bit too sketchy to me. 	1346652396

There is little doubt that the presence of oil have had an impact on the situation in the Middle East. US have been in the business of overthrowing the governments in the region for the last 100 years. Most recent invasions only reinforce this theory.\n\n1928 - [Red line agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Line_Agreement) to ensure US and Britain were part of the oil cartel. This is how they wedged themselves into the ME oil business.\n\n1944 - Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement drafted with the intension to divide the oil market between US/UK, later was conveniently swept under a rug to avoid public scrutiny.\n\n1953 - Iran coup organized by CIA immediately after Iran tried to nationalize its oil fields.\n\n1991 - Operation "desert storm" is undertaken for the sole purpose of taking back the Kuwait oil fields. \n\n1992 - [Defense Planning Guidance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfowitz_Doctrine) was an imperialist doctrine that had an overall objective to maintain the predominant power in the Middle East and to preserve U.S. and Western access to the region's oil.\n\nThere are many more instances of US intervention in the internal affairs of other sovereign states that I [left out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_intervention_in_the_Middle_East), but you only need to look at what companies are currently involved in the business of [pumping the Middle-Eastern oil](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/12/2011122813134071641.html), to realize that there is a reason why they are called an oil cartel.	1340490687

The lack of air is possibly the spirit showing you how he/she died. Spirits communicate through a voice in your head that sounds almost like your own thought, visions, symbols, and feelings. they show you how they feel like confused, sad and taking breath away can be signs that they died of a heart attack. Next time you get a feeling ask them to show what that means and you might get some visions that answer your question. Like a car accident. 	1324060681
Honestly, that is bullshit.   I had the pleasure of seeing a great Atheist Comedian shortly before his death.   George Carlin was not very funny, in fact I found him depressing as fuck.   Since he was an old atheist, and there was nothing left except for him knowing he was sick and waiting to die.  My husband was working at the theater that night, so he didn't see much of the show, but.... that was my opinion that I express to my atheist husband, and Carlin did die less than 2 months later. \n\nYou might think it's liberating.

To start off, your protip is the cutest thing I've read in a while. You should read some philosophy, and you'll understand that the subjective card can be played equally for all of these. Trust me, we can spend all of our life time disagreeing on what it is exactly to be a noun like an American, or a libertarian. \nEvery single word represents a slightly different concept for every single person. Dictionaries simply attempt to approximate the most commonly shared meaning at specific snaphsot of time for a specific context.\n\nAnyway, to more relevant part:\nIf you think I'm any more political than you, then that's again a sign of your naivety.\n\nIn fact, it is your definition of freedom seems to stem directly from American centric politics and government. Equal opportunity? If I kill everyone in the world, everyone will have equal opportunity. Would I have maximized freedom? Obviously not. I would have done the opposite, even though we all have equal opportunity when dead.\n\nEqual opportunity is simply a political strategy to provide *equal* freedom to citizens. But what is actual freedom that your politics are trying to maximize/equalize? The freedom is arguably the ability to act based on your *internal* impulses.\n\nIf a person desires x, then sure, you can make the naive interpretation that a person is free when they purchase a fraudulent product that promises x. A more meaningful interpretation of freedom though is the ability to actually achieve x.\n\nThat's the only concept of freedom of the two here that is actually worth talking about.	1345187384

I hate the idea of myself believing all this, but I don't really have another explanation for what has been happening to me. I'm more of a logical person (I'm a musician by trade) and feel ridiculous talking about this seriously. So here's my story:\nAbout a year and a half ago my aunt died. Her husband and kids are masons, but she was Lutheran. Her husband (I dont think of him as family anymore, you'll see why) despised her religion and basically would freak out anytime she took my cousins to church - to the point of abuse. I've heard that masons are into devil worship, but still that seems pretty far fetched to me even now. Well there was an enormous falling out while my aunt was dying of cancer, my immediate family and grandparents were banned from visiting and actually forced to leave the hospital when we tried to visit her because of the lies they had told the doctors about us. The funeral was an even bigger disaster that we should not have attended in hindsight. Very shortly after the funeral everyone who didn't get to say goodbye had an experience that was exactly the same which we found out after sharing our experiences were we were lying in our own beds and suddenly felt like a hand just laid itself on our back for a moment then the pressure eased up. Kind of like not a real hand but pressure in the shape of a palm. Each person shared this info with my mom who kept it quiet until about 5 of us shared the same thing and she started to kind of be wierded out and than told us we had had the same thing happen. Now fast forward a few months, we had some christmas light bells that play music when turned on with a remote. My aunt had the same set. Every day for about a week at 4pm these lights turn themselves on and begin playing carols. The first 2 times I thought it was a glitch from them getting old so I just turned them off. The 3rd and 4th times I'm getting frustrated because I'm at the other end of the house hen they turn on and theyre blaring carols till I can get to them to turn them off. So I decided to put the remote away in the box to stop the glitch I thought was the culprit. They still turn themselves on every day at 4pm. I finally put them away for good unplugged.\nThe next thing, if you remember my aunts husband was supposedly into devil worship - still doubtful, but this explanation makes the most sense. I started to wake up in the middle of the nights unable to move. Now I did research about sleep paralysis an all that an it does not match the descriptions. I am unable to move myself, but it feels like my body is moving o it's own. I have felt on different occasions that I am squashed up against my bedroom wall, sliding off my couch, being shaken like tremors, and sliding around my bed. My eyes are also closed, yet I can feel as though I can see around the room perfectly fine like they are open. So my mom and I started to use holy water every night, and this stopped, which makes me feel like it is not sleep paralysis. I am also an extremely deep sleeper, on vacation when I was 8 to Disneyland there was an earthquake and I did not wak up. So to suddenly have sleep paralysis at age 25 seems unlikely. Last night I had forgotten to use the holy water and I again woke up unable to move, but there was a sort of loud metal clang in my ears sort of a sensation like buzzing, and felt like I was moving around the bed. But I wasn't moving myself. \nSorry I this was incredibly long but if you have any thoughts I'd love to hear them.	1314609707

I never said science should go to another subreddit.  I just wanted to share my story, and heard about this subreddit.  I have never thought about the matrix, but figured this was a good place to post.  I would love to have a scientific explanation that can be proved by facts.  So don't act like I'm being ignorant.  Also, "a glitch in the matrix" is just a place for stories that make no logical sense, because the movie is a work of fiction.

If they're marketing him as a mentalist then he's supposed to prove how people can be fooled by simple tricks, not claim that he actually has magical powers or anything.

Check out the entry in The Skeptic's Dictionary on it: [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator®](http://www.skepdic.com/myersb.html)\n\nJust a quote from his response to someone at the end:\n\n&gt;One reader wrote me to complain that my "claim that any type to a significant extent fits most people is absolute nonsense." Perhaps others have also misread my concluding remarks in this entry. What I suggest is that some parts of the profiles could apply to most people, a characteristic shared by other kinds of readings such as astrological or psychic readings. I do not claim that any profile, taken as a whole, will fit most people. I am not suggesting that one type fits all. Since the various profiles are based on information the client has provided, they shouldn't be telling the customer anything about himself that he doesn't already know. Thus, just as psychics have many satisfied customers because they feed back to clients what the clients have told them, and they make claims that could apply to most people or that most people would want to be true, so too do Myers-Briggs folks have many satisfied customers. In any case, those who read the above article carefully recognize that the main problem is not with the accuracy of the profiles but with the way they are abused by employers and others.\n\nEdit: Added the quote from it as a semi-TL;DR--but seriously, all his entries are great reads.	1327285860

It does. Sharks (particularly bull sharks) have the ability to hone in on the electrical impulses given off by a human heart prior to an attack.\n\nThough there are several other signals and scents a human can give off that will attract a shark, it's well known that bull sharks (amongst several others) can and do hone in on humans sitting perfectly still in shallow water because of the electrical impulses given of by the heart.\n\nOther marine predators can sense electrical fields unwittingly given off by prey and use the signal to hone in on their location.\n\nThere are several other examples of the human heart giving off electrical impulses, easily checked by an EKG which can detect normal and abnormal rhythms.   \n	1305987490

He believes that scientists want people to stop believing because they want to brainwash people into not believing in God.

He'll probably say something about how man is easily corrupted and single out corrupted priests as just bad apples. He always finds a way for contradictions to fit into his delusion.\n\nIt's funny you talk about religious leaders making money because earlier today he called me and told me he bought some CD from the church that he wanted me to listen to and my first thought was, "They're making money off you."

I'd say no, primitivism advocates a 'returning to nature' way of life, that's not what I'm saying at all.

My point is to be careful about looking at chimps in order to understand ourselves, and that closest living relative is down to accidents of extinction of the other species that would have been closer to us were they still alive today.\n\nClosest living relative does not necessarily mean that they're particularly closely related. It really just means that there are no other closer evolutionary relatives alive now.\n\nOf course there are many similarities between us and chimpanzees, and to a broader extent between us and other apes, and us and other mammals, to even broader similarities between us and other vertebrates etc. We just need to be aware that we are a different species from chimpanzees, and while they can be helpful in understanding ourselves, they can also be misleading.	1290988873

Adding as a response to 1), you might very well be right about the impact for the rich world.  We might just have to get used to paying a bit more for certain things as technologies are adapted to compensate.\n\nFor the rest of the world, as fossil fuels (rapidly) double triple, and beyond in price, it's quite likely that this will result in millions if not billions returning to extreme poverty.  Just as 100 million people in china have risen out of extreme poverty in the last ten years, a rapid increase in transportation costs and other fossil fuel-related costs, would likely plunge at least as many back as businesses are forced to (temporarily) abandon supply chains that require too much transportation.  Eventually, the global economy would adapt to the new costs, but in the short term there would be a lot of pain and it likely take decades to require.\n\ntldr; **Markets are bad at dealing with scarce resources.**	1355751958

The presence of large amounts of aluminium has always been interesting to me, in terms of conspiracies.\n\nA friend of mine ranted about "thermite bombs" used in demolishing the twin towers. (Usual BS). I asked him what a thermite bomb was, and pointed out that thermite is a powder that burns incredibly hot, but can't ACTUALLY be used to make a bomb because it doesn't explode.\n\nHe largely ignored that and said the military has top secret bombs we don't know about, etc, but that doesn't explain why there was THERMITE RESIDUE in the ground zero area.\n\nI proceeded to ask him what thermite residue actually looks like. Because it would seem likely to me that it would be thermite-like. And thermite is actually just aluminium oxide in a powder.\n\nCan anyone else thing where a large amount of oxidising aluminium might have come from in this scenario? Hmmmmmm... Nothing jumps to mind.\n\nThe relevance here is that there could well be some merit to this point at least to the degree that the presence of aluminium could well have made the fire much hotter than a pure fuel fire would have.\n\nAnother interesting point is that just below the crash point of one of the planes (I can't remember which one) was a large UPS system. Think giant bank of car batteries. And that's what they are, metal and sulphuric acid.\n\nSulphur + aluminium = thermATE. Even hotter burning, and catches at a lower temperature.\n\nNot sure how relevant this is, but it's interesting, nontheless.	1317106290

Again what does this have to do with the thread?\n\n1.  Still waiting for one of the believers to write a coherent argument supporting the OP.  You are completely going off into left field much less actually providing a coherent argument.  If it doesn't need faith then spell it out, this is a skeptics forum; evidence comes before everything else.  Do you know what evidence is?\n\n2.  It is common for anybody who doesn't 'BELIEVE' to be automatically labeled as clueless.  I hear this from 9/11 truthers, creationists, PSI believers and the like all the time. They usually say, "you just haven't researched the evidence enough". What they are really saying is that "if you have faith the 'evidence' becomes obvious", which is typical religious thinking. Thanks for demonstrating this so thoroughly.\n\n\nAs it stands, this thread isn't in the topic 500 threads in the skeptics forum any more so there is no more reason to keep it up.  There are much better topics to post on.	1306691627

Toxic black mold, the infamous species of [Stachybotrys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stachybotrys), produces trichothecenes. These are a class of hideously toxic substances that cause [a variety of symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stachybotrys#Symptoms_of_Stachybotrys_exposure_in_humans). The Wikipedia article doesn't specifically list any neurological symptoms.\n\nWhether toxic black mold causes neurological symptoms is still under active research. The introduction section of [this study from last year](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808125/) explains that damp building related illnesses include neurological problems, and toxic black mold is associated with damp buildings. Also, trichothecenes are known to be neurotoxins. The part that they are studing is the exact mechanism of how the toxins get from the air into the body and damage neurological systems, which includes studying the dosages.\n\n**TL;DR:** It's very likely that toxic black mold will "fry your brain"; we're just studying exactly how it happens to make sure.	1335986315
Their "About us" includes: "and providing direct care for thousands of animals at our sanctuaries, emergency shelters, wildlife rehabilitation centers, and mobile veterinary clinics."\n\nThat explicitly states they provide care for animals.  They're called The Humane Society (of the US, with that latter part in small letters).\n\nOn their FAQ they also say:\n"The HSUS works with local humane societies and supports their work through training, evaluations, publications, and other professional services." After a short disclaimer, and that's the only place on their site that notes there isn't a connection.\n\nIf you check out actual Humane Society websites:\n"No. The San Antonio Humane Society is a non-profit no kill organization that relies entirely on donations, grants and self generated revenue to operate. We are not affiliated with any national organizations and do not receive support from the county, state or federal agencies."\n\n"No. We do not receive funding from, nor are we affiliated with, the Humane Society of the United States located in Washington DC, the American Humane Association located in Denver, or the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals located in New York City. We do not receive funding from the Heart of Florida United Way. The SPCA of Central Florida is a private, independent, 501(c) (3) non-profit corporation."\n\n\nHSUS is aware of the confusion, and benefit directly from it.  They don't mind giving people the impression that they render aid to local shelters, despite local shelters saying it isn't the case.\n\nShould people know better?  Of course.  Just because it's a person's fault for being mislead doesn't make the con-man "good" though.	1301610891

To be clear, I am not the person who initially charged you with strawmanning them, my point was to show you why your post was subject to that sort of attack, and to advise you of how it might be restructured so as not to elicit that kind of response. Also, I took issue with the facial legitimacy of some of the points in so far as they are indistinct from the other points or insufficient to undermine the general points made by the Four Horsemen.\n\nI've actually begun reading the work that you linked to. You would have done yourself, and reddit a better service if you had premised your points as being a summation of the book, rather than relegating that to a footnote. The form of this discussion then would have been over whether the book makes good points, and not whether your summation of the books points stand on their own without further evidence or explanation.\n\nTo put it another way, I'm actually quite glad that you brought this all up, but wish that you had presented it differently so that it could have resulted in a more fruitful discussion. 	1330569448

I understand it like this:\n\n\nDepending on the field, it refers to different things. There is a new branch of skepticism that is on the track with new atheism. Where a baby is an atheist (it has no belief in a god or gods... at least, I don't think so,) Atheism is now a kind of a movement towards science and away from superstition.\n\n\nAll human beings are going to be inclined at points, probably throughout any day, where they will be inclined to believe something that isn't true. Sometimes they will believe these things their entire lives.  People who dub themselves skeptics, at the very least what I try to do, is to keep ourselves in rigorous check of what we want to be true/feel to be true, and what in life demonstrates itself to be true in live via a multitude of examples.\n\n\nPhilosophical skepticism or radical skepticism is the doubting of all things, even those things that seem consistent, such as logical frameworks and natural occurring consistencies.\n\n\nRegardless of a word's etymology or original use, we need to be sensative to how people interpret our words as we use them for the same reason people should agree on the rules of Monopoly before playing. It wouldn't make for a very fun game, and just lead to a lot of yelling at each other for cheating. \n\n\n\nOne other quick example:  Post-modernism, depending on the field means very different things. Philosophically it means an end to modernity, and a crushing end to enlightenment, whereby there can be no single truth or unifying theory of everything. (in a very small nutshell.) In counseling, it refers to humans having very unique internal maps, and that counselors need to recognize that the client is the expert of their scenerio, and the counselor is just there to help the client understand his/her/its own terminology. In literature, I heard it in a nutshell as "the author is dead," in that regardless of how an author intended something to be interpreted, it is only the readers interpretation that matters.(I first heard this quote from Hank Green who I believe credits it elsewhere,) In art, it means bad art. :p  I hope this helps.	1355314293

I coped by thinking; I understand paranormal activity (if you want to call it that) now probably better than anyone on the planet because I thought about it... all the time. some times instead of doing something I'll just sit and think, and years and years of thinking combined with my experiences (basically I've experienced everything but possession). The best part is that some of it might line up with string theory. Also I've just ignored what ever has been around me until it shows it's self and then I attack it. I set my self into the state of mind where if I see something my first reaction is charge and attack, the issue is that I haven't seen a persistent apparition for a while. I've been followed by what people usually call feys, or maybe there demons, I'm not sure where you make the distinction, they're the same thing, one's just intending to do evil. I once caught one in a dream but she tricked me and got away. I found them all standing together in a group staring at me and then started to transfer dimensions I'm pretty sure which looks like they're sinking into the ground. They all have different animal associations and have eyes accordingly, black robes grey skin black hair. And that's about the extent of my story with out writing a book. Also on that topic I'm pretty sure that the way it works is that there's this dimension, and then two other dimensions one higher level than the other, the higher level is very dark and sort of purplish/ ultra-violet and the other one is also dark but red. At least that's what I've got from the patterns in dreams that seemed to be much more real and I'm guessing were at least partial astral projection sort of things. I still don't fully understand how it works with ghosts and matter interaction (noises and object movement) but I'm thinking about it. I should come to a full understanding in the near future hopefully.	1326100127

Well first off trying to associate me with McCarthy is logically unsound, for you don't have any basis to make that comparison. I never stated my personal experiences were not based on reason, or did not hold scrutiny from outside rational inquiry. \n\nEven deciding that rational skepticism is the best method of understanding the world is once again, subjective.\n\nAlthough I appreciate your sentiment, I do not appreciate you attempting to associate me - or even the idea of subjective experience as a foundation for rational belief with certain people and ideas.	1279035376
That's basically what I get out of it too.  I'm not so sure Romanek's mentally ill, though...I've listened to interviews with both him and his wife, seen the scant evidence he's put forward...it's all very elaborate.  Either this is a hoax or it's real, but I don't think he's being exploited.  \n\nEither this is earth-shattering, world-changing stuff or he's the one doing the exploiting.  I'm keeping an open mind, because his story's been consistent and he's offering a lot more than your average attention-seeker, but my bullshit meter is blinking off the charts.  I have a feeling this documentary is going to be make-or-break for the Romanek story.	1339638736

&gt;That was the only line I need to realise I am in the entirely wrong subreddit, if your basement-dwelling lifestyle suits you that's fine by me. \n\nI don't live in a basement, I'm a psychology master's student, I teach autistic children and I have constant girlfriends for the past five years (edit: I feel disgusted even bringing that up, but you seem to think it's important that I was having sex) and only took a break over the last six months. I've a handle on my life and I'm pretty damn happy.\n\nIf you have issues living in your basement and not experiencing the world, then stop doing that! Stop blaming all your problems on masturbation. More importantly, your worth is not determined by how many sexual partners you have. You have a warped view of sexuality that's been conditioned into you over the years. That's your issue. Not how much sex or masturbation you're having or not having, the fact that either way, it takes complete control over your life. You don't have to have sex to be cool or to have value. There's so much more to life. Promiscuous sex is fine if you like it, but if you think it determines your worth that's ridiculously unhealthy.\n\n&gt;All science is based on interpretations of data and hypotheses, funnily enough masturbation research wasn't at the forefront of scientific discovery for much of the last century and most of the research is being done this century, meaning less proven science that has stood the test of time.\n\nAlso, I don't think you understand. A hypothesis is an *untested* idea, often derived from data not directly on a topic! A *theory* is an interpretation of numerous sources of data that directly link to it. Those leads us to make decisions. Both are techincally interpretations of data, but theories are a lot more objective, whereas hypotheses are *possibilities*, of which there is usually a myriad of. Making decisions based on cherry picked hypotheses is madness.\n\nEdit: clarity and mistakes	1344246973

&gt;You probably should not waste time with Archie. He uses, 'skeptic' to mean, those who agree with his position. \n\nActually, I don't. In my mind, a "skeptic" is someone who evaluates the scientific evidence before accepting or rejecting a theory as correct or not. The evidence strongly supports AGW theory, therefore it is very likely to be true.\n\nNow, AlyssaMoore and others will gladly claim they agree with AGW theory, just not the "catastrophic" part - but when you ask them to define what "catastrophic" means they quickly change the subject.\n\n&gt;Clearly he has no grasp of the meaning of the term.\n\nI think I have a better of the term than you do, oh great meddling troll.\n\n&gt;This is fairly typical of the level of Archie's discourse. He seems to have a rather poor grasp on 'logic' and 'the scientific method', and he just argues for the sake of argument.\n\nReally? Then I guess it should be easy to point out a logical flaw in my argument. Please, be my guest and explain to me where I got it wrong.	1332769013
Awesome find!\n\nFor anyone who hasn't had formal training on arguments, keep in mind that a fallacy is just **one** way in which an argument can be flawed.

I kind of wonder ...when they appeared to the people of early earth, they were...gods..and we were nieve..weak..easy to control. Now that they are back, we have become more intelligent, less controllable..and braver to defend ourselves. They can't just come down here and say ' bow to us..we are your God"...ya...that's not going to happen. When we come across an aggressive animal..we stand back and watch...go slow..yet in plain view. Maybe they don't need to come down to us because they have the sensors necessary to complete thier goals from up there. Maybe that is thier goal...to let us see them. So when they do land, it will not be so fearful to us. I think, to them, we are like cave men and our under developed brains couldn't handle thier level of evolution...who knows..what ever it is...or why ever it is...we will find out soon and my guts tell me that when it does happen..it is not going to be very good.	1355976026

Thing about them is that My hand is on my chin in one picture and the next is my hand moving downwards, as if this picture is showing a timeline of my movements.\n\nThis is exactly how double-exposure works. If you do a Google image search for double exposure, you'll find lots and lots of examples.\n\n&gt;But this was a digital camera (most people are using Iphones/Androids to take pictures). I don't think a double exposure is likely.\n\nDigital cameras are capable of double exposures.\n\n&gt;the apparitions in photos have become more and more frequent.\n\nDo you have any at all that you could post for us to look at?\n\n&gt;The thing that has me the most freaked out, is that the internet says that evil ghosts can take the form of a person they are after. I even say that on the tour.\n\nDo your best to become un-freaked-out by this. If you wrote down every claim that every person has made about their personal belief in supernatural events and compared the entries, half would likely be rendered impossible due to fundamental conflicts, and the rest suspect due to there being a lack of proof outside of personal experience and assumption.\n\nThat's awesome that you do ghost tours, but don't lose your grasp on two of the greatest gifts humans have evolved to use; critical thought and skeptical inquiry.	1336075840

"Herbal medicine" works perfectly well, provided that you're going with the definition of "medicine" that means "things which have been proven to work being used in an effective manner." Unfortunately people tend to abuse "natural" remedies by using them either in ways in which the active ingredients are completely ineffective, or even dangerously by using some plants that shouldn't be taken over a long period as a supplement due to mistaking a *treatment* for a condition with something that will *prevent* it.	1303974589

I grew up in a house with a lot of activity and lived there as an adult for several years with my children. \n\n1. My moms bf lived with us, a pilot with a major airline of 20 years at the time, came face to face with an older man in 18th century clothes in the master br doorway. this lasted 5 seconds until he turned to shout at my sleeping mother and it was gone. He left that moment and didnt set foot in the house for weeks.\n\n2. as a kid, I often woke up to the sheets billowing down perfectly as if someone had just tucked me in.\n\n3. I would  often wake up to the sounds of someone going in the bathroom and doing their business, when I would sit up to look after listening, it would go away and the door was open with lights off.\n\n4. as a teen, a pet lab use to wake me up in the middle of the night by laying on my chest and threatining to kill something above my head\n\n5. when my sister and friends were telling "true" ghost stories when in our living room, every lightbulb in the house went out. seconds after I said "stop talking about this stuff or something will get mad". Literally every lightbulb in the house needed replacing with no reason to suspect electrical issues. I left immediately down the street to a friends when it happened and refused to come home for a few days. I was about 10 years old and it scared the hell out of me. I't wasnt until my 20's that my sister and mom told me every bulb was burnt out, even closets that were never used. A 4 br 3 bath house with a finished basement. Im guessing 60 bulbs total. The fact that they turned off after I said sent me running\n\n6. I woke up once to see a painting that had hung on the north wall of my br for years, hover above my friends sleeping head and crash down on him as soon as I said in my head "WTF is that"\nI was a teenager and my brother was off to college, the double beds still remained and a friend was spending the night. I opened my eyes from a deep sleep to watch a painting hover over his head for maybe 3 seconds, and then it fell flat on him. He woke up asking wtf and I explained exactly what I saw. This was the same now grown up friend whose house I ran to years before, he never doubted me once.\n\n7. FF to my late 20's, the house has been unoccupied for a half a year and I am fixing it up. I am in the family room which has a view of the front door and foyer. The foyer has a view of the living room and the bottom 4 stairs that take you up. When I am in the family room, my 4 yr old step son makes an odd noise and I see him in the foyer, frozen staring in to living room. The only way to explain it is like he just saw a ghost. he turned towards me and stumbled over his own feet frantic to get to me. he was panicking but when he finally made out was wrong he said someone was in the house. I rushed outside and went next door. I was sure nobody was in there since i had been all over and you can hear anything in a bare bone house. Me and my neighbor went in with our weapons of choice and acted all tough lol to find no one in there.  When my step son calmed down, he told us about how a man bent around the wall coming down from the stairs and motioned for him to shhhhhhhh. This is the point where he shit his pants and froze. If you saw you would have no doubt he saw something. the description of the man closely matched what my moms bf came face to face with 20 years earlier.\n\n8. I saw a human figure rush from my bedroom , across the hall to my sons bedroom and I chased after it. probably about 1 am, I was in the upstairs bathroom smoking out the window when everyone slept. we had 4 kids in the house and the mrs at this time. I opened the door to go back to the bedroom and saw what I assumed one second was my wife/gf and the next realizing it certainly wasn't. my first step I was thinking "OMG whats wrong with her, is billy ok" and the next step I was realizing whatever I was rushing after isn't the mrs.. When I turned the corner I found the room empty and him sleeping soundly. I spent an hour cursing that ghost daring it to come back. It seemed to have a malicious intent the way it rushed in MY FUCKING KIDS room, I was pissed and wanted a ghost fight. I put my son in our bed and dared that mother fucking to make a peep. threatened with every christian and voodoo bullshit I could find on the planet to send it to a place it didn't want to be if it didn't go where it was suppose to. I was honestly more angry than I have ever been and was confident I wasn't threatening a figment of my imagination. I said a lot of things in that bedroom that night and I dont know which is to blame, but I haven't heard a peep since. \n\nI have since move out of the house to raise my kids elsewhere. My mom currently lives and will probably be there in 20 years\n\n	1342239131

Do not accept. Nothing worth knowing is not worth examining. Chiropractic theory has been examined extensively. The theory was made up, it has no basis in human physiology or modern medical science and is worthless.\n\nNow, in order to further evaluate your claims, we'd need to know what was done? Some traditional and standard physio-therapy - sure, a recent study showed that this was the most effective treatment for non-idopathic lower back injury. Is this Chiropractic treatment - NO. Just because a Chiropractor does some physio, doesn't mean that it was Chiropractic treatment.\n\nTai-chi - sure, some calming exercises and range of motion might indeed improve someone's back issues. Is this Chinese medicine using the theory of Qi - NO. Just because a Tai-chi practitioner does some helpful body stretching movements doesn't mean they've balance their Qi (or Chi).\n\nSo, indeed your observations are worthless to this discussion. Sorry. 	1327965746

Yeah, language is far from perfect. What do you mean by lack of a 'strong belief'? They have a weak belief? That would make them a theist who's not very convinced of their belief. If you instead meant someone who lacks a belief in any gods, then that would make the people that disbelieve in all gods a subset of the first group that just lacks belief. This first would be any atheist, while the second would be a hard/positive/gnostic atheist.\n\nIf the definition of theist was added to the dictionary, it would, if done properly, have to follow people using it in that manner in actual use. Actual use leads, and dictionaries follow. I'd argue against people using it in this way, as it further muddies the waters of communication, and hope that it changes.\n\nThe terminology only matters to have clear communication. If someone else uses a term in another way, and explains what they mean, then we're communicating. I explain how I use the term differently, and why, and hope others use it the same way.I'm not trying to push it on them, but instead trying to convince people that it's clearer and more useful way of defining the word.\n\nIn a world dominated by theists, I think there is use for a term describing the set of all people who are not theists, regardless of the particulars of why they are not theists. What word, if not atheist, would you suggest for this?	1296249342
The unfortunate truth is you're working in sales, and if you say anything to discourage a customer from buying a product, you risk being fired.  You could talk to your manager about whether the store should keep selling it (or whether it should be displayed with a "not vegetarian" sign) but ultimately it's a management decision. \n\nEDIT:  Afterthought: I think suggesting to your manager that it be displayed with a "not vegan/not vegetarian" sign is a great idea.  It may reduce sales of that product, but I think it would increase customer appreciation and loyalty.  If you manager goes for it, you'll then be safe in answering the question "what's in it?"	1327357893

For the most part from what I've read and observed, they don't.\n\nI keep hearing this, but I have yet to see actual figures about this. For example, the whole "Climategate" affair is all about whether or not temperatures are increasing, i.e. if climate change is indeed happening. I see a *lot* of deniers/"skeptics" constantly attacking people like Mann and Phil Jones, even though the trust of their research is about whether temperatures are increasing or not.\n\nSo I think you're mistaken. The mistake is probably rooted in the fact that you're assuming the arguments on the part of deniers/"skeptics" to be rational and consistent with each other, but the reality is that it's rarely the case. Many people who doubt "clmate change" will follow what others have called the climate change denial ladder:\n\n* First, question whether it's really warming up, attack the various official temperature records, with the exception of Roy Spencer's (an anthropogenic climate change denier) because it is ambiguous.\n* When confronted by solid argument that the records are in fact mostly right, and that temperatures *have* been increasing, claim (with emphatic certainty) that it is due to natural causes\n* When faced with the incontrovertible evidence that human-generated CO2 warms the atmosphere, claim that the effect is very limited or near saturation\n* When faced with evidence that the effect is significant and nowhere near saturation, claim it will actually be beneficial, and not catastrophic (CO2 is plant food! Cold kills more than warmth!)\n* Finally, in the rare cases where deniers/"skeptic" will concede that the effect is real, significant, and won't be beneficial on the whole, they'll claim we can't do anything to change it, and thus will be forced to adapt.\n\nObviously, a given denier/"skeptic" will go back up the ladder at the first opportunity, therefore being caught in a loop of irrational arguments, wishful thinking, and cognitive dissonance.\n\n&gt;They do however question the causes.\n\nThere is as much evidence supporting the theory that the warming is man-made than there is pointing to the existence of the increase. AGW theory is quite solid, as scientific theories go (a side-effect of being constantly attacked over the past few decades), and in order to question it you need to put forward evidence that shows the *current* evidence is somehow wrong. No "skeptic" has been able to do this yet.	1342286701
It's a bit ridiculous. Not sure about the history of "gun control" (vague term that can mean any number of things) in totalitarian states, but I'm willing to bet that yes, they probably controlled them. They pretty much controlled everything; that's what "totalitarian" means. Just to address the dumbest thing on this, though:\n\n"During WWII the Japanese decided not to invade America because they knew most Americans were ARMED!"\n\nBullshit. The Japanese "decided not to invade America" for the same reason Australian has decided not to invade China - it's an utterly inane idea. They couldn't. The Japanese were stretched thin throughout the Pacific. Their goal was domination of Asia. Not only could they not get the men and material across the Pacific to accomplish what would have amounted to the largest invasion in history, by far, but even if they COULD have done it, why would they expend vast resources to occupy a territory that had nothing to do with their strategic goals?\n\nAlso, I don't have time to research this currently, but I'd be interested to compare gun control laws in Western European countries - U.K, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, etc. - which I'm pretty sure all have far fewer guns and far less violent crime than the U.S. I will bear factual correction on this, if this is wrong.	1355898985

I like to think that it's possible that we are on a simulation of a future generation.  This would be to argue the whole, we are running a simulation at the same time as the people running the simulation.  Time is what you percieve it as.  So for a Matrix Computer, so to call it, running it simulation(s), it would be as us loading a program, or skipping forward in The Sims.  For us it just goes in regular motion, because we are still bound to our perceptions of time and space, and need to act out all the events in our daily lives.  They can speed forward in it as they are watching because it's a program, meaning everything is predestined.  Everything happesn for a reason.  God knows everything that is going to happen in the all of time.  The thing to check is if this Matrix Computer is running more than one simulation at the same time.  Could we figure out the computer language and communicate with the other simulation(s)? 	1356938143

Two possibilities. that came to mind for me. Aura, and bi location. the second relies on the first.\n\nAura is a thing that all living things have, from bacterial life to slime molds to humans and everything else. IT is an energy around all life, and in individuals with a strong enough one, it can feel like just another limb. It is entirely possible, that that was your first unconscious separation of the aura around your arm. With individuals with particularly strong ones, the aura feels more real than the arm. AS for the bars, it could have been many things, water pipes, electrical wiring (often magnetic or electrical force con exibit similar effects of solid mass to flesh that it does to aura), squirrels.\n\nNow bi location is complicated, and relies on a belief in part one. Assume it is true for now, just for simplicity. Bi location occurs when two people who have both previously interacted with one another, are both less actively aware of their surroundings. Either through intoxication, being tired, zoning out, or something else. IN addition both people's auras must be in similar strength, and compatibility. The last bit is that one person is not conscious, and that person will bi locate into another persons body.\n\nNow Bi location seems like a complicated BS reasoning for dreams. The difference being that when bi location occurs, your mind acts out a much stronger version of the placebo effect, in which your body will inflict the same physical state on you that your mind experienced when bi located.\n\nI have had one experience that I can remember with bi location. I was walking around my old school from when I lived on the other side of the country. I interacted with an old staff member who did not teach there when I attended, instead he was hired on as a temporary replacement for someone after they left when the school was announced to be getting shut down. When I woke up I remembered everything, so I act checked it. I had not thought about that place for years, turns out everything was accurate, even the staff.\n\nSo... I hope that helps you out Crocquack.	1350506152

I've never seen him this bad.... he's really treading on becoming too crazy for armchair conspiracy types to take him seriously, which was his biggest demographic in the past. It's funny how he's like "I really shouldn't be telling you this", because he *knows* it's too batshit sounding. \n\nI also really do think he believes this shit... All signs point to clinical paranoia. I mean, yah, he makes a living off it, but it's pretty obvious that he's a highly religious dude.... and that he comes up with these theories to deal with the cognitive dissonance he experiences trying to explain the world in such a manner that religion is the infallible "[big good](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood)" it claims to be. 	1308965472

"He said humans were not going to be able to establish contact with the extraterrestrials through radio waves but through the power of thought."\n\nTake a second and think that if this was real, it could very well be what was considered prayer in religion. These mother fuckers probably came down in their "fiery chariots" ufos thousands of years ago and ruled all of us. They're our gods.	1350995902
&gt;And, as you say, It has been shown that it's no better than placebo.\n\nHe was actually saying that it has been shown to have some effect beyond that of a placebo not that it has been shown the same as a placebo. Random needles are not the same as a placebo, placebo would be to somehow make the person think they had been stuck with needles when they hadn't, which I'm not sure how you would do that.  \n\nIn theory acupuncture could work in the following manner, the pricks with needles could cause the body to release some sort of anesthetizing agent, thus it doesn't matter where the pricks are, but the pricks themselves would cause some reaction, now I have no idea if that happens or if it was in fact the placebo effect that caused the reduction in pain, but the former is a possibility as far as I know though I haven't really researched it so it could have already been proven that doesn't happen.\n\nAlso note that if being stabbed with tiny needles does in fact cause some reaction in the body that reduces pain, it certainly isn't for the bullshit magic reasons acupuncturists claim it is, so in that sense acupuncture is horseshit in that their claims about how it works are, and even if it does have an actual effect for other reasons, the people doing it have no clue why, and it doesn't matter where the needles go,  so paying someone who doesn't know what they are talking about lots of money to stick needles in specific places when the places don't matter is kind of a waste of money.	1296951298
The paragraph I quoted from mentions criticism by Nancy Ammermann, a professor of sociology of religion, directly beforehand. She was not involved with the cult but rather employed by the US government to analyze the incident. [She doesn't seem sympathetic to the organization at all](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Ammerman#The_Branch_Davidians_Siege_Episode). Hence, characterizing her as a "cult apologetic" seems inappropriate. The connections to Scientology he draws in the [source for the quote](http://www.rickross.com/reference/waco/waco3.html) between the other experts involved in the case, including Ammermann, is rather indirect.\n\nI don't know if she herself is religious, since her Wikipedia page doesn't mention anything about it, but that's beside the point anyway.\n\n(P.S.: Looking at the article by Ross, it's clear that she's not the only one he has called a "cult apologist" - in fact he has a whole page of supposedly such page on his website. I only looked up Ammermann because she's mentioned in the Wikipedia article. I'd be interested what independent evaluations of the rest of them turn up.)	1342040009

I actually had a [discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ey8lx/why_dont_all_these_so_called_moderate_atheists/c1bvdqv) recently where I was advocating the "Don't be a Dick" mentality. A few people disagreed with me, but as I talked to them more it turned out we were defining "dick" in different ways.\n\n I was referring to someone who uses insults and makes rude comments or jokes that add nothing to the discussion, but they were viewing it as simply being assertive and not worrying about offense. We actually ended up in agreement.\n\nI know a lot of people will use harsh words here (it is an atheist forum so I think it's okay to poke some fun) but they might not use that "tone" in a debate or discussion with a believer.\n\nEdit:\nI say insulting/derogatory jokes about believers in various types of nonsense all the time around my atheist friends, but I try to be as respectful and and polite is as possible when engaging in a dialogue with a person that doesn't share my view.	1295076741

Unfortunately the first video is fake, as can be seen in this analysis: http://i.imgur.com/YQ0EI.jpg\n\nThe top frame is from another video posted by guy who posted the first video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXCEj-fOyEc\n\nThe following frames are from that first video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ-bNOy_CKQ\n\nAround 0:58 of that video the camera suddenly pans up to follow the UFO flying off in to the night.  At that point you can see where he has sloppily mirrored the background image to fill in the areas to the left of the original image.  The pattern of the lights is perfectly symmetrically.  But the patterns of the lights are completely different beyond that point in the later video.\n\nThis is conclusive proof that the video was put together in a program like After Effects (a default setting in After Effects to extend images is to mirror them)\n\nI was pretty sure for a while that this video was real, and that all (except the "close up" video) were real.  But once I saw this in the original video it stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\nIf the first video is fake, it stands to reason that all videos that follow are fake too (unless you can come up with a plausible scenario that would explain why a fake video would be released before a real one)\n\nI know this revelation won't be popular as the Jerusalem videos have been very popular and cited as "good" evidence for UFO's.. but the fact is, the videos are fake.\n\nIf we want to get to the TRUTH of what UFO's are and what aliens are and what they are doing here we MUST scrutinise the evidence.  When we discover overwhelming proof that a piece of evidence is fake, we MUST accept the fact that it is fake.\n\nAccepting any and all evidence as proof takes us AWAY from the TRUTH, not closer.	1300207959

Yes, he's been posting in earnest since May (when he pled guilty) though he had posted a few things as far back as December. He started with YouTube, and then gradually extended.

The problem is after one time you use the Ouija board, it can open a portal to the spiritual planes that is hard to close. The more you use it, the more it wedges open that door. Just because you haven't used it in a while, doesn't mean that door has shut any more. Bargaining and playing with demons is serious business and although it may just be games it's playing now, it could get to the point where it can physically harm you. Also there is lore that if an entity knocks and you open the door to answer and check, it is technically inviting the entity into your home to better contact/terrorize/whathaveyou to the inhabitants in the house. Its possible it might not even pester your mom, but mostly you because if you've been experiencing the paranormal since a young age then you probably have a aura of energy that unknowingly attracts spirits. Even if you cannot get a professional to come, check up on cleansing rituals. No matter the religion/spiritual belief, there is some sort of cleansing/exorcism/banishment ritual you can perform to rid you and the house of spirits. Holy water/prayer, smudging with sage, there is much more out there. If anything, have your significant other perform it with you so that he is cleansed as well. It seems to be attached to both of you.	1345094101

I've been growing more skeptical recently with the lack of good evidence and the supposedly scientific and critical researchers being anything but. My beliefs about the lack of good footage are a) there's nothing real to show in high quality, everything is faked or mistaken identification (I'm basically here as an optimistic skeptic waiting to be convinced), or b) people are frigging stupid when it comes to recording evidence.\n\nRecently I watched what was supposed to be a fantastic bigfoot video. The video quality was great. You could see a dark mass behind some bushes, and after several seconds, the mass moved and it looked like an animal, but possibly with a humanoid shape. In less than a second after the creature moved, the cameraman whipped away and the two witnesses ran off, even though they were under no apparent threat. I immediately felt like it was a hoax. If it wasn't, why didn't those idiots stay put at keep recording? They'd obviously felt secure enough to pull out a phone, start the camcorder app, hit record, etc.\n\nTips for investigators:\n*Get a tripod\n*Use low-light technology; I think the reason everything is indecipherably bad is because cameras just can't get a lot of data in low light (because physics)\n*Grow some balls and dedicate yourself to dispassionately recording evidence in a scientific matter, without freaking out, talking too much, jostling the camera, etc.\n\nIt's depressing how often people are willing to accept supernatural answers without seeking out a more obvious one. Humankind has been suffering from this for millenia; it's only from a scientific approach that we've stopped accepting thunder is caused by gods fighting. If people would stop responding to their reptilian brain tendencies and tried some scientific method in their evidence gathering and evaluation, maybe we'd see some better evidence.	1352752137

This is not how news station reporting works.\n\nThe cameraman is just some guy. I've worked for local news stations, and the camera operators are not guaranteed to be rocket scientists. \n\nAnd the cameraman doesn't decide what goes to air, the producer does. The actual story is being run by the reporter who writes the material. The cameraman just does what they are told. They have no authority at all. \n\nThe cameraman may well be some jaundiced old hand, or a pot smoking cynic, a believer, or someone who doesn't give a shit either way. There are all types. \n\nIt's just as likely that the cameraman thinks this is a silly season story and hasn't given it any further consideration than not. \n\nThe actual footage that went to air was enhanced in the editing suite - that's probably not done by the cameraman either, might have been done by other crew, depending on the size of the station.  	1353295496

Personal revelation is all the evidence one needs." and think anything would come from it.\n\n&gt;Do you feel objectified, sir or madam?  \n\nAwesome example of not understanding the topic at hand. To go from objective to objectified, it answers that you truly can't tell when false equivocation arises.  \n\n&gt;I just feel like the discussion could have remained civil, and I was attempting my best to keep it that way.  \n\nMy apologies, frustration got the better of me. I was hoping it wouldn't go that direction but when it did there's not much else to be done, it seemed to show a flawed understanding of how things operate and I'd have no idea where to start.  \n\n&gt;A lot of my ideas actually have stems in Kant and Berkeley. So I don't see how I could possibly be impressed with what you seem to have decided are "my own ideas" when I am literally practically quoting the two aforementioned philosophers...  \n\nThat was in reference to you thinking of psychedelic experience as being a valid reason to believe something or affirming the existence of something. And what? You say that we need to wipe our preconceived notions yet you quote people? Doesn't that sound a little hypocritical?\n\n&gt;seriously it's actually produced anxiety in me that you've gone and acted this way. I suppose maybe I am too empathic.  I didn't even ever downvote you...  \n\nMy apologies, time to chop up I think.  \n\nI presumed you didn't, they are because of the tone and it is the minority view in this sub, there are plenty of morons who use downvotes instead of words. I don't touch the arrows if there may be disagreement, it doesn't make anything said any more valid. I usually up the first one or two and then forget about em.  \n\nNinja edit: Then again, I wonder how many believe in the supernatural because of psy's.	1352368830

I will never forget the episode where he is driving up to this house resting his arm out the window, when he gets there he lifts up his arm and says "I've been scratched!" and shows his arm to the camera, his "scratch" is clearly the imprint from resting his arm on the car door, that one made me laugh.	1344576921
Skepticism is a movement?	1241155505
If something exists in the fourth dimension, then we see only a cross-section of it, like how a flatlander sees a cross-section of a 3-dimensional object when it passes through the second dimension. Likewise, a 4D being could actually appear and fizzle out of existence within our dimension. \nThen again, you can argue that humans are 4D in some ways because we have duration, and from conception to decomposition, we fizzle in and out of existence within the third dimension and see only a cross-section of our 4D selves as we age.	1355418132

"So, I was walking through the woods (which happen to have fresh tyre-tracks running through them) when I spontaneously decided to film my dog.  But just after I turned on my camera, I happened upon two young girls one of whom was about 3 meters in the air and rocking or pivoting slightly around her pelvis (almost as if she was wearing some kind of harness).  The girl dropped back to earth (although I seem to have missed this bit, but I'm sure it wouldn't have betrayed any signs of jerkiness/unclipping of harnesses etc).  The two girls then walked away quickly, but I decided not to follow them because we see this kind of shit all the time in Russia; but my dog decided to leave with them.  (almost as if he knew them!)" \n\nSounds legit.	1351299954

He's not adding the nursing science specification on purpose.  It is not a BA in Nursing Science, but a BSN, a separate degree.  He would be lying about his qualifications if he failed to say that it was a BSN.

True, but when confronted with facts you were able to come to the realization that blood is not blue. If I couldn't get a girl to see the truth about something as obviously bogus as a powerbalance bracelet, it would make me question the long term potential of someone who cannot be reasoned with once they become stuck on something.\n\nI guess you could say that refusal to accept valid data in place of personal opinion is just another type of annoying quirk, but to me it's a step above stuff like snoring, smacking while chewing, or having a preference for pterodactyl porn.	1316680797

&gt; Skepticism isn't a brand name. You can be skeptical of evolution, cats and dogs or anything else.\n\nYou can't really be truly skeptical of evolution. Either you accept it, or you are ignorant. A true skeptic would look at the actual evidence, and would quickly conclude that the scientific theory of evolution is correct. As such, his actual skepticism would last for a very short time indeed.\n\nAnd to use myself as an example: In the past, I didn't give a shit about climate change, global warming or whatever. I was completely ignorant of the facts. But I wasn't a skeptic. I just didn't know anything, nor did I care. If I was to be a skeptic, I would need to care, and start weighing the evidence.\n\nWhich is also what I did after Climategate. The discussion that followed was interesting to me, and for a very brief time I was skeptical of both sides. Then I educated myself, and realized that the denialists were as full of shit as creationists are.\n\n&gt; Besides they have a freedom of speech just like anyone else.\n\nSure, but that doesn't mean their dishonesty shouldn't be pointed out.	1294763848
Ok.  This will take a while b/c you have to get through a lot of information to get the crux of what Im saying but this is an ok place to start:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw_O9Qiwqew   He mentions the field theory I was talking about and some books/studies you can look up.\n\nFrom there follow the references he mentions about his work and that of others.\n\nNext follow up with the work and information you can find here:  http://www.parapsych.org/home.aspx\n\nFinally, if you're really interested see if you can come across the studies on remote viewing and the declassified results that was done by our the US government.  Now this area is far more sketchy and filled with a lot of disinformation etc so Im not relying on it.  But if you can believe the results they showed that, yes, they could take anyone off the street, train them in basic remote viewing up to a point.  It showed they would have most success in the beginning of the work (as they arent clouding their expectations) the success would drop enormously and then with practice and continued work they could reach a level of similar aptitude if they maintained the discipline.  Sorry I dont have links to this right now... I'll see if I can come up with some.\n\n\nI also think you misunderstood my evolution context and that was my fault.  The mind is far from fixed just look at neurology to get that.  Its a given with modern understanding that we can effect its effectiveness - see all the studies that say things like: meditation helps reduce stress and increase memory, Sudoku helps stop the onset of Alzheimer etc etc.  My meaning of evolution was not biological evolution but social/cultural evolution but I did not clarify that so I understand your reaction.  Biologically and fundamentally I agree, our minds have not changed much since we became homosapein, if at all. But thats my point, this ability has been in us since before the development of language and is quite common in the natural world among animals (see the Raden video he mentions that too including studies).\n\nBest of luck.\n\nOh and why not, why are you so vehemently certain that no one can ever develop these abilities?	1351340620

I really wish that these kinds of articles would mention the methods used. While it might be safe to assume that these guys blinded themselves, and were able to detect which ones contained "natural" ingredients without knowing what brand of coke they were, it would be nice to know that they have actually had all the proper controls in place instead of just assuming that they did.\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that many scientists flaunt all the proper requirements for a good experiment. In medical science this seems to be rampant unfortunately.	1304572549
&gt; In times of rapid social change...\n\nDoes this describe the current situation? In the middle-east and north Africa, sure. Perhaps even China. But I'm not convinced you could say the same for the Americas and most of Europe.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of hyperbole is extending the specific into the general. Not only did Sagan qualify that statement to "times of rapid social change", but he suggests that such paranoia is limited to the particulars of that social upheaval. Wondering about secret experimental airplanes is one thing. But when you stretch the bounds of credibility too far it becomes believing in alien autopsies.\n\nOr, give a conspiracist a hammer and everything looks like a hidden nail.	1353356131

&gt;UPDATE: I'll try and rephrase a point that I didn't get across before. /moviecritic and /atheism aren't legitimate top ten reddits. They appeared that way because they were under attack, making them appear even more popular. Removing atheism from the top ten by hand isn't about censoring, it's about a shortcoming in our popularity metric. We'll fix the problem, and that'll be the end of it.	1251342567
Well, not quite. To be a stickler for accuracy, what they actually believe is that you must take a substance that causes the symptom you wish to cure, dilute it to the point where none is left, and then it should cure that symptom somehow. Basically, if you used ethyl alcohol with the homeopathic process, you'd come out with the greatest sobering up agent of all time (theoretically).	1315867009

I am not a conspiracy theorist. I believe Oswald acted alone, I believe Islamic fundamentalists attacked us on September eleventh. I also believe that where there is great power, there will be efforts made to wield that power. I believe that in 2008 there was an amalgam of events that constituted a concerted extra-legal effort to make Bush the president, and it succeeded. I believe there are also efforts to manipulate our democratic efforts now. I believe that there is enough evidence to implicate Lyndon Johnson when he ran for the Texas senate for ballot manipulation as well as many other politicians. It is not a partisan issue. If these people do not respect the interests of the average American because of their greater loyalty to campaign money, there is no reason to expect them to respect the democratic process. If all facts were available to us, I am reasonably certain we'd find a government corrupt beyond our most cynical expectations. \n\nThis is all based on my 40 years on this earth and the repeated and relentless efforts to pervert our government for avarice driven interests, corporate, union, or otherwise. \n\nThe only time working people matter is when we burn the palaces and hang our "rulers" on the trees and lamp posts of our communities. \n\nRead your history. The working man doesn't matter till he rises up. And then it is only a matter of time before he is subjugated back to his *proper* place of ignorant servitude and grateful subservience. \n\nThe lies on television designed to manipulate the public voice save us from armies that would crush us for the same purpose. Our illusion of democracy saves us from the military subjugation our rulers would require in lieu of our ignorant support.\n\n"An optimist believes this to be the best possible world.

The only theory that sounds remotely plausible, to me anyway, is that the original footage from Apollo 11, if there actually was any usable footage, was somehow destroyed, and in order to show the public, and "win" the space race, they had Kubrick recreate the footage.

The world will follow the 'others'. By this I mean a world founded on principles that will allow us to move forward both culturally and spiritually. \n\nI think it will play out as rapidly changing current events leading to a paradigm shift. Those that don't want to experience the shift will lead a life similar to those who are still mad that Obama was voted into office; they will be bitter, they will probably find the world unfair, and they will probably wonder how everyone keeps guessing what they are thinking. Again, I think it will be subtle to the point that those who think this is all bullshit will continue in that thought process; the shift comes from within each one of us and spreads out from there. I think the shock will be just how many people are ready for a true change.\n\n&gt;How can you be sure that, as some believe, you will be able to see the portals ?\n\nI can be sure of no such thing at all, nor do I necessarily believe portals will show up.

No, I'm just stating the fact that eye-witness accounts are not reliable: http://agora.stanford.edu/sjls/Issue%20One/fisher&amp;tversky.htm \n\nAnd that you have not provided a single shred of evidence that contradicts the scientific evidence put forth by the NIST. Nor are any of the quotes you have provided relevant to the topic at hand. \n\nNo one was questioning if there was molten metal. That part is true.

I'm always skeptical about the claims of any anarchist. Quite simply anarchy can never exists for very long. From chaos some form of order, of government will arise. \n\nPeople will always form into some form of order, some form of structure. Be that in a tribe or in a modern democracy. Humans are creatures of individualism and community. It's not either or, it's this and. This communal aspect will always grow in some fashion.\n\nHowever, it can get out of control where the community oppresses the individualistic aspects of humanity. Modern democracies at least try and draw a bounds around what the community (through government) can do to an individual.\n\nTLDR: Anarchy doesn't exist anywhere for very long.	1333690804

I'm almost through and something startles them I assume cause I begin to hear hissing and tails rattling. I'm scared to look back to see what it is and focus on just trying to get out of the leaf and snake infested area. I'm one step away from the clear when I feel a sharp pain on my lower calve/ankle area.

This isn't true everywhere, it varies state to state exactly because in some places it's been successful argued that they're not good evidence. But yes, they are often ADMISSIBLE in court. That does not mean they're considered good evidence. It just means they're not illegal to bring to the table. If the only evidence you bring to a court case is a second-hand account of a death-bed confession, you're going to lose, for exactly the reasons I listed.

\n&gt;multiple photon absorptions of microwaves shouldn't be sufficient for bond-breaking, let alone ionisation damage to DNA.\n\nYeah, shouldn't, but I have yet to see a computation demonstrating this. Yes, the energy of microwave photons is a million times less than UV, but the intensity is probably a billion times higher, possibly even more. There are much, much more microwave photons per cubic centimeter in a microwave oven than there are UV photons right under your skin. My gut tells me that the probability for multi-photon absorption goes down exponentially with the number of photons (in which case there should be no risk), but I'd rather see a treatment by an expert on the topic than try to figure it out myself.	1345986202

I see where you are coming from, but you're letting your 'anti-woo' feelings get away from you.\nThe doctor of Chinese Medicine I see was a practicing MD in China who relocated to the US and decided to practice traditional medicine here.\nHe uses acupuncture, but is very open about healing coming from the correct use of medicinal herbs. When I asked him if he could help my Mother when she was diagnosed with cancer, he said no. He said there is nothing in any alternative medicine that can react with the strength and speed that is required in treating cancer. He said he might be able to strengthen her body in dealing with the chemo, but we didn't go that route.\nI have multiple stories in my family of MD's causing harm by misdiagnosis. I don't think that the process of diagnosis is well taught (in the physicians I've seen at least), and I have wondered if the scientific methodology for it needs improvement.\nBut, in any case, maybe some day I'll meet an MD who knows how to treat me as a person. I remain open to that possibility, just not hopeful.	1316265724
here's an article from a website i occasionally read\n\n"What's awesome about Ouija boards is that the real reason it works is almost as spooky as the ghost explanation: You're actually communicating, not with the dead, but with the subconscious part of your brain. Your hands move the piece across the Ouija board due to involuntary movements in your muscles, which are called the ideomotor effect. Basically, your brain can and will move your muscles without your express permission because, for the most part, your body kinda operates on autopilot anyway. It's just usually not brought to your attention (you'll notice it the next time a light stops working in a room, but you unconsciously keep flipping the switch every time you walk in anyway).\n\nSo with the Ouija board, you subconsciously think of a response to the question and your brain subtly moves the planchette where it wants it. Maybe not enough for it to work if you were using the board alone (though it is for some people -- it's likely how water dowsing works), but when you get a few people together and they're all subconsciously pulling, it creates the distinct sensation that the planchette is moving on its own accord. In theory, ghosts should be able to direct their hands no matter the orientation of the board, right? Turns out, without being able to see the board, they just kinda move their hands to where they think the letters are."\n\nRead more: 6 Scary Tricks That Amazed Us as Kids (Explained by Science) | Cracked.com http://www.cracked.com/article_19506_6-scary-tricks-that-amazed-us-as-kids-explained-by-science.html#ixzz29Jxs3WXo\n\n\n\n\n	1350255532

From the source material:\n&gt; While most humans are clearly “behavioral” omnivores, the question still remains as to whether humans are anatomically suited for a diet that includes animal as well as plant foods.\n\nNo, this is not in question. We are suited to eat meat. When we eat meat, we get nutrients from it, a benefit which far outweighs the cost of eating meat. Thus, we are suited for it. This isn't hard.\n\n&gt; The masseter and pterygoid muscles hold the mandible in a sling-like arrangement and swing the jaw from side-to-side. Accordingly, the lower jaw of plant-eating mammals has a pronounced sideways motion when eating. This lateral movement is necessary for the grinding motion of chewing.\n\nWe don't really grind side-to-side like dedicated grazers. Our incisors and canines prevent it (try it right now: separate your molars a tiny bit and see how much lateral movement you have). An herbivore like a [horse](http://www.britannica.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/horse2.jpg) doesn't have this problem, as the incisors/canines don't interlock as arcs at the front of the jaw.\n\n&gt; [In herbivores] The temporalis muscle is small and of minor importance.\n\nhaha. [Gorillas are herbivores](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24704473@N07/5880477367/), you big dope. What muscle do you think goes up in that pocket on the side of the skull? The *giant* temporalis.\n\n&gt; Many of these herbivores increase\nthe sophistication and efficiency of their GI tracts by including carbohydrate-digesting enzymes in their saliva.\n\ncommon misconception. Salivary amylase doesn't noticeably affect digestion. It prevents the buildup of insoluble polysaccharides in the mouth, which would otherwise cause tooth decay.\n\n&gt; Bears have not, however, adopted the flattened, blunt nails seen in most herbivores and retain the elongated, pointed claws of a carnivore .... An animal which captures, kills and eats prey must have the physical equipment which makes predation practical and efficient.\n\nSure, but what about non-predatory meat eaters? Bears can hunt and kill prey (even deer!) and thus have claws and teeth capable of subduing large, living animals. Other omnivores (many rodents, raccoons, skunks, etc) do not have "killing bodies". They scavenge, eat defenseless young of other animals, or eat invertebrates.\n\n&gt; The [Human]  canines are neither serrated nor conical, but are flattened, blunt and small and function Like incisors.\n\nThey are not quite pointy, not quite flat. They are thicker, so they can take more lateral stress than incisors and shear better than molars. Give someone a big piece of tough jerky. What will they almost always do? Put it in the side of their mouth, bite with the canines, and rip it away with the hand. Our canines still tear well. They aren't made for punching holes in the neck vessels of prey, but they aren't reduced to grinding surfaces or missing altogether. They're between a typical herbivore's and carnivore's. ...shocking...\n\n&gt; Human saliva contains the carbohydrate-digesting enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme is *responsible for the majority of starch digestion.* [emphasis added]\n\nAs above, this is demonstrably FALSE. Our pancreatic amylases do that work. Salivary amylase is destroyed by the stomach proteases. If the claim was true, potatoes would dissolve in our mouths. They don't. They dissolve in our intestines.\n\n&gt; There is also extensive bacterial fermentation of fibrous plant materials, with the production and absorption of significant amounts of food energy\n\nCitation needed. I am not medically aware of any substantial caloric gain from the large intestine contents. By the mid-ilium, most of our nutrient absorption is done. vitamin B12, bile, and a few bacterial products are absorbed in the distal small gut, but the colon is pretty much there for water balance.\n\n&gt; In conclusion, we see that human beings have the gastrointestinal tract structure of a “committed” herbivore. Humankind does not show the mixed structural features one expects and finds in anatomical omnivores such as bears and raccoons.\n\nLOL. He just discounts the evidence that we ARE a hybrid form between dedicated carnivores and herbivores. We can't digest cellulose unlike the grazers. We can't bring down large prey with only our bodies like apex predators. We have teeth both for shearing and for grinding. We have reasonably close herbivorous cousins (gorillas) with vastly different anatomies suited for fibrous vegetable food. We have close omnivorous cousins (chimpanzees and bonobos) with dentition and GI tracts much like ours. \n\nTL;DR: the source material ignores all of the omnivorous adaptations we have, falsely dichotomizes the world into predators and herbivores, and is flat out wrong many times. It's pure bullshit. The guy is cherrypicking and distorting evidence to support his beliefs much like a creationist.\n\nEDIT: wow, thank you for the reddit gold, anonymous person. Tokens of appreciation like that are encouraging, and yet I am almost embarrassed that what was just a whimsical, snarky rebuttal got this much attention. Anyways, many thanks.

&gt;Sure, but then it's not necessary to call it anything other than incorrect, it's not that you're saying it's wrong, it's that you're calling it laughably wrong that I take issue with. \n\nBut it *is* laughably wrong--I often laugh aloud when reading such things. How does me relating this fact to peers 'hurt' anyone? Even if it does 'hurt' anyone (and, to be sure, such words are only capable of doing so in an extremely superficial sense), why should that weigh on my prose? I laughed when I saw the recent "UFOs over Denver" video, and [I shared it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/13724u/cnn_many_subreddits_stunned_by_shocking_video_of/) (where it was well-received, for what that's worth) with a decidedly derisive (and, in the end, [perfectly accurate](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/13da3k/this_is_the_denver_ufo_meeting_followup_post/)) title featuring my best guess at a more likely explanation. Is your position so aggressive that you think that post doesn't belong here as-is? If it *does* belong, why would anything I've advocated here be at all objectionable?\n\n&gt;I don't particularly see the need to call it stupid, laughable or any other negative term nor do I think that the beliefs are stupid, merely wrong and irrational\n\nI don't personally say "stupid", but I do say "uninformed", "laughable", and similar fare regularly. These are accurate descriptions of their irrational beliefs, I see no reason to not let someone I am speaking with know that this is how I view an issue. If it causes them to dismiss me outright, that is their loss at least as much as it is mine.\n\n&gt;something like "I'd stop calling these people stupid if they act and believe like I do." which, to me, isn't too different from "Hey, I'd stop calling these people fags if they weren't so gay."\n\nExcept, ~~again~~ {EDIT: I appear to have confused you with someone else in the same thread who committed the same error, my apologies}, that it's completely different than in your example because I'm "coercing" (read: posting comments that some *may* find somewhat objectionable on a publicly available website) people who **have chosen to subscribe to a particular worldview as a group**, *not* people who belong to some non-self-selected group and not any particular individual that I might be engaged with. My "y'know, super hurtful" comment was meant to capture the idea that people do not have a right to not be offended, that being offended from time to time is a fact of everyday life, that periodically being offended does not in fact do an individual any actual harm, and that offending someone in the course of expressing an opinion is not in any way shape or form "bullying", nor is it even something that justifies accusing another of being mean-spirited (let alone some greater claim) on its own. Please stop insinuating that I am a bully simply for posting my opinion in an honest format in an open forum--it's disingenuous, *flatly* untrue by definition, and unfair to the victims of a very real problem in our society. I would earnestly prefer that you consider rescinding the remark as a poor choice of words.	1353381519

The whole autism/vaccine link is supported solely by one article, the Wakefield Study, which has become a shining example of scientific misconduct and incompetence.

I'm sorry, but you're trying to move this away from the scientific towards the political, and I'm not really interested.\n\nThe fact is that deniers have politicized the debate about whether AGW theory is correct or not. I'm not really interested in discussing Libertarian politics with you.\n\n&gt;And there aren't green interest groups that favor government intervention for gain?\n\nIrrelevant. Only one side is denying the science.\n\n&gt;That still doesn't mean it was not once presented and gained significant support.\n\nWell, it didn't. Even in the 1970s there were more scientific papers predicting global warming than there were global cooling.\n\n&gt;I was bunching the terms because there is a history of failed theories by climate/ecological alarmists.\n\nThere isn't, actually. The Ozone layer problem was a real one, and so was Acid Rain. Furthermore, a scientific theory is judged on its own merits, not on those that preceded.\n\nIt seems you are trying to politicize a scientific debate for obvious reasons: indeed, Right Libertarianism fails when confronted with problems such as Global Warming, which require the intervention of the state. To acknowledge man-made climate change would require you to accept that Libertarianism isn't perfect, and that is anathema for a ideologue such as you. Thing is, science trumps ideology, every time. Sorry.\n\nSeriously, don't bother responding if you're not going to make this about the **science** of global warming.	1350869907

SCA-style swords made with PVC pipe can be very painful, even deadly. In fact, at least a few decades ago, they were banned as a no-no for various reasons, IIRC, so PVC isn't entirely safe for all uses... ;-)\n\nedit: [that is no longer the case](http://youthfighters.eastkingdom.org/Documents/BofferWeaponGuide_BasicSword.pdf) if it ever was, though the webpage says to use something stronger than the traditional duct tape, because PVC can shatter on impact, causing dangerous splinters.	1354582841

I still don't know what to say...\n\nI still think it could be a viral marketing campaign, but as more and more videos come up its tough to feel sure about any conclusion.\n\nRegardless, without the original video, all this "disproving" that has been done has been well-intentioned but flawed at best, imo. The additonal videos could have just been added to the first, but who knows? we shall have to wait and see...	1296625497

Each recounting, story, and interpretation holds a piece of the truth - is a piece of the puzzle.  Realize, however, that it is only a piece, and you or anyone would be foolish really to look for any "ONE" person or story to hold the sole truth to the ET phenomenon.\n\nThe ET phenomenon is as vast as the cosmos itself.\n\nInstead, simply take in every bit of information from all these sources, and simply piece them all together in a mosaic.  The pieces will form an image of what actually is going on.  It will likely be a very confusing image, but it will be an idea none the less.\n\nDo your own critical and independent examination, and then combine that with what you read and hear from other sources.\n\nCombine, discard, etc, etc . . . and continue on that road investigating, understanding that the truth of the matter is likely a bit more complicated still.	1336187000

I used to work with students with autism. It was a residential program so, I was in charge of helping students with their diet. You would be surprised how many parents insisted on their kids being on a gluten free diet. They were convinced it lessen symptoms.\n\nA parent gave me the example that she took her son to the movies, caved and let him get popcorn. She said his symptoms immediately got worse, his tics increased in frequency and intensity, etc. I looked it up later and found there is very little gluten in movie theater popcorn. \n\nThe student reported being around his mother raised his anxiety because he felt she was domineering and overly-involved. Anxiety increases tics. And so, the cycle continues. :/	1330785551

I only asked about your profession because I find that most people who are vehemently against osteopaths (and osteopathic medicine) tend to be outside of the medical field.\n\n * As a DO I'm allowed to attend an MD residency if I desire. \n * As a DO I'm allowed to specialize in any specialty I choose... I recently watched a DO pediatric heart surgeon repair a ventral septal defect on a neonate. \n * As a DO I'm allowed to practice medicine in the US military (there has even been a DO surgeon general)\n * Many MDs take "crash courses" to learn osteopathic techniques\n * All US medical insurance companies recognize osteopathic treatments and will reimburse for them\n\nIt seems that DOs are pretty well recognized across the board. So I was just wondering what makes you so confident that it's BS while so many organisations recognize osteopathy as legit.	1335313612

Those first two statements were meant to show you that I wasn't born yesterday, as you seem to think by talking down to me... and it obviously had no effect.\n\n&gt;claimed that "pull it" is demolition-speak for blowing up a building. **However, it is not.**\n\nYou can convince me of that by simply telling me what is "demolition speak for blowing up a building". This is a crucial point in any "pull it" discussion. I understand that you've already said that you do not know. Perhaps it would benefit your argument if you found out.\n\nI cannot disagree that some people have taken parts of that "specific video" out of context.\n&gt;You are trying to make some odd, roundabout argument that doesn't actually have any relevance.\n\nI'm sorry, but it is relevant. Industry professionals always have industry related terms for various aspects of their work. You can't just pick and choose the ideas/terms that support your own personal convictions. \n&gt;Do you think that Daniel Nigro and other FDNY are lying in their statements about WTC7[?]\n\nI already answered no to that question earlier.

That reminds me of a conversation with a friend about the plane that landed in the Hudson, and him casually mentioning that based on the implications of losing power at that altitude during takeoff, that God clearly didn't want them to die that day.

The feeling of strangeness and what could have been a hallucination actually sounds quite similar to a simple partial seizure.

The deeper relationship SciAm (which last I checked, was fairly reliable) is hinting at isn't all that deep:\n\nBaby Stem Cells migrate to help repair damage, increasing survival chances for both mother and child. \n\nOr that the baby cells might cause the immune system to respond to similar, yet non-identical cells (like cancer cells) better that someone who hasn't had cells like that present in the body.\n\n\nThat's a deep connection, but not deep like "Oh, babies know their mom's don't want them if they're an unwanted fetus because of magic psychic"  bullshit I hear about. You know, the kind that's like "I or a dumbass friend of mine invented this because I don't like abortion and you're winning with your real facts and I can't make ethical arguments properly so I need to make up bullshit." would be if the ". \n\nAnd let's face it, a lot of this "fetus-mother have a magical pyschic connection" bullshit is spouted by people who are pro-life and can't make a compelling argument without woo. Or moms who are dumbasses and want to try and make themselves sound better just for having popped a kid out of her birth canal.\n\n(Don't get me wrong, abortion opposition has plenty of facts and can be well argued. Just a lot of hyper-religious types tend to be dumbasses and try and use Woo to win arguments.)	1354842494

&gt;I agree, can you define to any degree of certainty what situation, settings or environments where all women would agree that they would be open to flirtation or be seeking potential romantic candidates? \n\nHow about "Not work environments" for starters?  Again, this part of the discussion is irrelevant though, as flirtation is NOT the focus here.\n\n&gt;Can you define for me just what this means, and prove that being "marginalized" isn't due to something else? \n\nIt means that there is an unfounded assumption that the lack of women in leadership and technical positions (for example) is simply assumed to be because of some physiological difference between men and women despite the shocking lack of any actual evidence that this is the case, and in the face of the large amount of cultural stigma against women being in those positions.\n\n&gt;While I certainly agree this has happened at times to certain individuals, this doesn't mean that every woman that isn't promoted or isn't paid equally is an act of male chauvinism. \n\nNobody is claiming that this is the case for EVERY woman, but when the median income for men and women holding the same positions differ, that is somewhat telling.\n\n&gt;I would agree but until one can have an objective way to make the determination of genuine vs unrelated discrimination it's impossible to claim them all as genuine. \n\nAgain, nobody is claiming they are ALL genuine.  Are you claiming that it isn't a problem?  That the gulf in income between men and women holding similar positions is not because of discrimination?\n\n&gt;I would agree until homosexuals want different penalties. That is a cry for special treatment. \n\nIt is understandable to want crimes of equal severity to carry the same punishment.  However, if you believe as I do, that criminal prosecution should not be about payment of a crime but rather only be targeted to attempts to reduce/eliminate it, then similar crimes with differing motives can indeed warrant differing levels of consequences.\n\n\n\n\n	1325802461
&gt;For example, we cannot do a double-blind study where we assign half of our group of children to a domestic abuse situation and half to a non-domestic abuse situation. Instead, we may choose to do a qualitative study on children who were exposed to abusive homes previously.\n\nOf course, but you don't need to do a double-blind study in order to do a quantitative study. A lot of the research in educational psych is quantitative as well, but they use observational or longitudinal studies. \n\nI don't deny that there are a lot of qualitative studies done, my only quibble is with the implication that they form a majority, or even significant minority, of the research done in psychology - i.e. enough of it done to invalidate the "scientificness" of the entire field. \n\n	1338434670

I'm nowhere close to an expert on scripture, but I'm not scared of claims that it's all been edited or changed to mean something it was never intended to. Ignore that statement, though, and let's just say that I don't believe God would let His teachings be ruined and altered, thereby letting humans cut God's actual truth out of the religion He intended for us. My thinking along this line will likely irritate you or make you throw up your hands. Anyway, since I believe God guides the Church, if anything, I believe any changes in scripture were intended by God and were not flip-flops or Him changing the rules. It all belongs to Him. God can neither deceive, nor be deceived.\n\nThe traditions of the Church have undergone development here and there, but have never actually changed in any huge, radical way.  It is always preserved in some way during troubled times - like now, with several decades of modernism finally, slowly showing signs of being purged by tradition once again - and it actually remains radically the same. St. Athanasius was an incredible example - *Athanasius contra mundum!* Schisms and heresies led people away, but their proponents left the Church by their actions. Heretics never win against the Church, they just cause it to suffer until they leave or are anathematized or excommunicated. They usually end up accidentally helping to clarify and improve things, such as with the Council of Trent.\n\nBasically, I would say tradition has undergone relatively minor changes throughout time, none of which meaningfully altered the substance and character. \n\nThere wasn't some humanistic, relativistic early tradition that was seized and altered by narrow-minded zealots to be an institution simply intended for control and conformity. If that were all it was, it would have ended so easily at some point. It's not just a regime like some sort of super-government. \n\nJust sharing my thoughts here, by the way. I've intended to state things as I see it, but not as though I am not an authority or expert.	1313139102

Nope, but I'm probably a hipster. I like indie music (including the music my friends make, [example](http://fugue.bandcamp.com/)), I like "good" coffee, I care about fashion, I try to consume only sustainable goods, etc. Also if I lived in NYC I'd probably ride a singlespeed because it would be a better workout than a 10 speed or something.\n\nBut [yes](http://i.imgur.com/61xOZ.png), [seriously](http://i.imgur.com/YRQbJ.png). There's a "discussion" like that at least once every couple of days. They're not overwhelmingly intellectual discussions but they're not stupid either. And, going back to shiv52's post, I would be depressed as hell if the depth of my friendships went as far as getting drinks with them. That's boring as hell. I want friends I can talk to and depend on, not people I'd despise if I actually got to know them.\n\nIn retrospect, shiv52's comment is probably one of the most depressing things I've read, and a hole I hope I never fall into.	1318701431
I don't understand the question.  It was exactly as effective as other recommended treatments.  It worked the same.  It had the same effects.  It showed no statistical difference in outcome.\n\nYes, it works.  It is better than placebo.\n\nBut this study is, I must note, only about lower back pain.  Chiropractors will claim to be able to do a lot more than that, but they have only been proven to be effective in treating back pain, and as per this study, only lower back pain.	1336388568

Notwithstanding Article 7 of Chapter 113A of the General Statutes and rules adopted pursuant to that Article, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources shall not deny a development permit for the repair or reconstruction on its original footprint of any residential structures with total floor area greater than 5,000 square feet and constructed prior to August 11, 2009, when the basis for the denial is the setback requirements set forth in 15A NCAC 7H .0306(a).\n\n&gt;SECTION 2.  Rule‑Making Authority. – No later than October 1, 2011, the Coastal Resources Commission shall adopt temporary rules consistent with the provisions of Section 1 of this act.  Notwithstanding G.S. 150B‑19(4), the rules adopted by the Commission pursuant to this section shall be substantively identical to the provisions of Section 1 of this act. The temporary rule shall remain in effect until a permanent rule that replaces the temporary rule becomes effective.\n\n&gt;SECTION 3.

Keep in mind that aspirin was derived from willow bark at one point, and penicillin from mold. The revelation that a study showed that there may be naturally occurred biochemistry out there with greater affect than currently synthesized medication should not be considered inconcievable by itself, and an attack on the positive result rates in the very wide field of 'psychology' should not invalidate any individual study's methodology either. Clinical psychology/psychiatry, which relies on very standardized double-blind methodology, is very different from the esoteric experiments performed in social psychology for example. 	1337652084
How do you a do a double-blind trial to test an economic claim?\n\nJust because you can find some similarities between the study of economics and the study of science does not mean the scientific method is an appropriate course of action.\n\nSome problems are intractable; which is how the Austrian school approaches economics with regards to empirical data. That doesn't mean they don't want to be rigorous.	1313596155
I think unless he told you about this dream before hand, its very likely just a form of Déjà vu. This sort of thing happens to me all the time.

Alright, I have semi long claw marks spanning across my entire back, (going down, not across) , I have faint scars on my inner arms, and small scars on my palms. The scars on my back and inner arms occurred from the same event; I attempted to reject a female spirit who chose to become obsessively possess over me, keeping me at protected from other spectre interactions while I was about 14 or 15. She became too much to the point of nearly hurting those in the physical realm who took my attention from her. She is gone, however she made sure to leave her mark.  The ones on my palms are all gone due to growth, but at the age of 9 I attempted to physically attack a spectre of questionable origin. It did not work out well, and lead to a major mental trauma as well.	1344227712

"Except"? I *just* agreed and said it's in the post. But there is still dispute as to whether this impacts TED itself -  but the point if being TEDx is made in the post. I couldn't make the point of the difference between TED and TEDx (assuming there *is* a difference - which is itself an ongoing argument) in the title, since that's irrelevant to the overall point.	1333248767
&gt;David Evans formerly worked (until 2006) in the Australian Climate Office where he did research into AGW. Evans has as much credibility in the field as any other person. There is no degree in climatology that I’m aware of, nor is there a certification or professional body. James Hansen, the main man in the field, is trained in physics. Persons in the field come from a wide range of disciplines, many of which touch on climate. A person who’s degree is in physical geography or chemistry is just as qualified if not more so. \n\nThat's all fine and dandy, except that [Evans is an Electrical Engineer](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/David_Evans_(Australian_skeptic\\)). Evans' arguments have been [thoroughly debunked by Tim Lambert](http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/07/18/the-australians-war-on-science-16/),	1354471253

I don't think PageRank gives much juice to these links, frankly.

The home I grew up in was built in the early 1900's, so some weird stuff would go on. My father would have single handles rattle audibly and visually on a dresser, the shadows caught in the corners of your eyes, and stuff being misplaced in ridiculous places. \n\nMy dad always called it Uncle Creepy, and would always welcome him/her to stay, as long as it was welcoming to and kind to our family. I would hear footsteps at 3 am and other stuff growing up, but it never bothered me or scared me. When alone you had a near constant feeling of being watched, but in the sense of someone watching out for you. \n\nI think you should welcome it, and lay down ground rules. If it's kind, or a human spirit, I think it will honor your wishes.	1342260218
&gt; That still doesn't change...\n\nTotally irrelevant non-sequitur that had nothing to do with my original point.  Flog that horse all you want archie, but I pass on arguing irrelevancies.\n\n&gt; your lack of knowledge... is much bigger than mine\n\nIt is to laugh.  I seriously don't think you understand any of this.  If it weren't for (un)SkS feeding you talking points even more of what you write would be reduced to gibberish than already is (which is most).\n\n&gt; your side keep saying...\n\nWell, given the first part of all this is just a stupid straw man that once again has nothing to do with me I'm just going to ignore it.  As for the second part, the point you make is once again irrelevant to the discussion.  IF the study wasnt a steaming pile of horseshit then MAYBE it would be relevant to the topic at hand.  But it's not.\n\n&gt; I don't see how I could get any dirtier...\n\nNow THAT was hilarious.  Apparently the only one who believes in conspiracy theories in this discussion is you.  \n\nYour arguments are so bad, pointless and irrlevant I'm rapidly beginning to think you're some sort of parody account.

That happened to me too; it was exactly like those coin-operated vibrating beds they sometimes have in motels. There was a loose pane in the window that registers the slightest tremor, so I know it was the bed only. I searched high and low for the source of the vibration, and then sat on it for ten minutes in wonder before going about my business; I don't know when it stopped, but it went on for hours. Funny it never occurred to me to just lie down and enjoy it; too disconcerting I guess. All I can think of is a dead kitty who considered that bed his in life.	1336067934

I appreciate your curiosity!\n\nSome of them are commercial farms, although they don't need giant plots of land, because "beyond organic" techniques are actually much *more* productive/profitable per acre than even high-intensity modern monoculture/CAFO techniques (note that this, among other things, puts the lie to the blog the OP posted). Use this: www.polyfacefarms.com/ as a jumping-off point, feel free to explore as your level of interest guides you.\n\nThanks for the cite  and good-faith effort - I knew that it didn't make sense that organic pesticides would be *more* toxic than their conventional counterparts. [ed note: on second read, I misread your point earlier - my bad] \n\nI'd never advocate for traditional organic methods as the solution, and in any case, pesticide toxicity (which is one of the more... tangential concerns of the sustainable ag movement, to say the least) definitely wouldn't be one of the reasons I'd advocate for organic ag. Besides, regulatory capture has rendered the US "organic" classifcation meaningless.\n\nSomething interesting I note reading through your blog, there - I think there's a real danger in relying on generalists to make evaluations about field-specific claims. Let me illustrate: \n\n"Some in the organic lobby have said that organic farming reduces or eliminates the need for added nutrients by rotating crops and better managing the soil. This is true, but it's always been true of all farming, and is in no way unique to organics."\n\nThis isn't the point at all! It's like the author has never heard of topsoil depletion, soil desertification, or soil sterilization.\n\n"To make synthetic fertilizer, we start with nitrogen, which we extract from the atmosphere. This process is infinitely sustainable and produces no waste."\n\nUh....[Nitrogen fertilizer production is tied directly to natural gas, the energy source used in the United States to synthesize nitrogen-rich ammonia from thin air](http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2010-02-12/tracking-us-farmers%E2%80%99-supply-nitrogen-fertilizer)\n\nAs we know, fossil fuels are infinitely renewable as well! Not to mention the atmosphere's limitless ability to absorb waste carbon.\n\nLook, I could go on, but my point is that you should be very careful about relying on generalists like this when considering a specific field. Often times, like in this article, what they say may be technically true, or logically true, but it also oftentimes forms an incomplete picture of the situation. \n\nIn any case, if you're interested in a refutation-through-practice (the experimental method! Joel Salatin's (Polyface's owner/manager) opinion of academic debates like this is really pertinent too) check out that link earlier. If you're interested in conventional v organic v sustainable agriculture, check out *The Omnivore's Dilemma* by Michael Pollan (who *is* an expert in the field, and includes loads of citations/resources in his works), and stay curious!\n\n(dawg, by the way, is always acceptable in informal situations, at least in the circles (sweet ones) that I run in. and the day i hold myself to a standard of formality on my internet message boards is the day i heavily reconsider my time-management choices, lol)	1310608313

There's only one way that sprite tastes and coke and Pepsi flavors aren't too varied, so...well I can't say what would happen. I'd have to see the experiment.

Given your second paragraph, it seems you're taking this a bit too emotionally and so didnt understand. Or you're just an idiot, but lets assume its case nr. 1 (Also you possibly dont understand what "rational" means). \n\nI'm not saying what he's doing isnt good, right or that exposing bullshit is somehow wrong or bad manners or some such. What i'm saying is that its in no way *smart* or rational to knowingly put yourself into serious danger for a relatively trivial reason (there's nothing life threatening for anyone about the situation, the whole thing is very local, etc.), especially when there are far safer alternatives.\n\nBut thanks for your reply, your a grade A example of overemotional and irrational people preventing reasonable discussions if they even slightly relate to something unpleasent.  	1334242135

I'm a bit of a skeptic, but read this genre as good-fun fiction.  Bear with the sneering quotation marks :)\n\nIf this is true, this bit gets me:\n\n&gt; We were all standing in a circle in the parking lot just talking. We had either just gotten done smoking, or were playing hacky sack. Now that I think of if, we were standing to close to have just hacked. I think we were done smoking, and standing around smoking cigarettes, talking.\n\nOk, maybe you don't remember because it was 10 years ago.  However, when people have 'really' had encounters, repressed memories can be involved.  The starting point for finding the memories are to recount the event and look for logical gaps when the details get fuzzy.  You can rationalize a scenario, but you don't really know for sure how you got from memory A to memory B, and it makes you a bit uncomfortable thinking about it.  UFO/spooky 'experts' jump in with hypnosis at this point to 'recover' the lost memories, but since hypnosis can also plant false memories, the witness/victim can never be trusted again.\n\nThe text I quoted you on sounds like any missing time you might have had started right before you were in a circle.  In other words, your spooky encounter was *before* you remember seeing the craft and blocked in your mind.\n\nAnyway, try to think really carefully: what was the last thing you can clearly remember before you were standing in a too-close circle.  Any images, sounds feelings?  Do they make sense? Can you remember the next moment?  That sort of critical thought begins to dredge up (or fabricate, depending on your expert) any buried memories.\n\n	1348486605
I... love you?	1348707639
Good points. Nice to see you here discussing this stuff. I think you basically nailed it.\n\nI am one of the few people who are 'not necessarily in favor of  disclosure'. I seriously question if humanity is ready for it; mainly because humanity has such a massive ego that many of us are not ready to have races more intelligent than us knock us off the top sentient tier. The same ego that currently has most redditors dismissing such discussions as kooky to the point of not even wanting to say 'what if?'. I always make comments in r/space that get people all worked up due to 'lack of proof'.\n\nI agree that subconscious fear plays heavily into it. I doubt if it's something to seriously be afraid of, but our paradigm is bound to come crashing down if disclosure happens. That's scary enough. As for them visiting, if their motives weren't peaceful I'm sure we'd know it by now. We wouldn't stand a chance fighting against that sort of intelligence and technology. How do you fight against telepathic extraterrestrials if you don't have telepathy?\n\nI would go further and say that there is some other underlying reason why this info is not being disclosed. Something major; something which would make all countries align in an effort to keep it secret, or at least so it is dismissed as hoaxy or delusional. Not sure what that might be. That they seeded us as a race, maybe?\n\nSuch a fascinating topic. I could go on for hours.\n	1283808387

This argument is self contradictory.\n\nThe author, Dana Nuticelli, is trained in physics, not [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology), the theory of knowledge, but here he is making an epistemological statement, not one concerning physics.\n\nIf, as he insists, only experts in a domain are qualified to speak in matters concerning that domain, and given that he is not an expert in this particular field, then he has just disqualified himself from making his own argument.\n	1349755705

Hi, Mr(s). Pubilus LXXII (I hope I got that right) -- My name's Jfred, I'm the local mod (with my good friend kylev), and I just thought I'd say hello and explain some things.\n\n1) Reporting people for libel is not particularly effective, as there is nothing I'm likely to do to remove anyone's comment in this subreddit. The only such comments that get removed are ones that threaten people, reveal personal information, or are obvious marketing spam. Everything else stays. Look at that, free speech!\n\n2) Lying is not a bannable offense either. If you think he is lying, prove it! In /r/skeptic we value hard evidence. Surely if you provide that evidence, and enter into some honest discussion (without *a priori* considerations or conclusions), then I think you'll find most of us open and willing to engage you in that kind of discussion. If they aren't, they'll hear from me when I notice it.\n\nSo, I just wanted to note all that to you. I made the assumption that you're new here, if that's wrong, take this as a belated welcome. I hope that this clarifies when it's okay/useful to report comments in /r/skeptic.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n	1355371404
I completely agree with what your saying.  Radio waves certainly arent the best way to broadcast that we're here, but theyre pretty much the best we have for long distance communication.\n\nBut on the off chance that someone heard us, they would have to be sufficiently advanced to pick up that same signal and therefore should know how to create it to respond, or know of a better way to contact us back.  Them replying with a crop circle is equivalent to us going to some planet and tagging "Earth4Lyfe" on one of their bridges.  Crop circles are man made, regardless of whether someone else figured out how they did it or not.  Anything else is Ancient Aliens-level speculation.	1354662577

Birds (especially Gulls native to the area) were a serious contender for the analysts - When the navy discounted birds the Air Force took over the analysis and their conclusion was even more startling - They concluded that the objects were 'intelligently controlled flying craft' but not planes.

Being shocked might be true but only because we have been brain washed for so damn long. Once everyone knows the truth, they will find that if the aliens wanted to do us harm, they could. Man kind, just like me, has to realize that there are certain things that are in our control and there are certain things that are out of our/my control. Once you realize that, then you can say fuck it, whatever happens, happens. I mean, we can try to fight with our stick and stones but I'm sure they could fuck us up at will. \n\nIt could be that they don't want us fucking up space like we tend to do down here on earth.

As a skeptic, I can't jump straight out and call bullshit on these cloths. However I have no reason to suspect they would work better than any old terry cloth towel to do the same job.  And I bet you won't be able to do very many windows with the same cloth without them getting mucked up.\n\n* For starters, the antibacterial claim is taken care of by silver. That one is true. Just don't try to ingest silver, it will turn you blue eventually.\n\n* There are existing products like Mr. Clean's Magic Eraser for taking smudges off of walls that work.  http://home.howstuffworks.com/magic-eraser.htm\n\n* Water is still an effective substance for cleaning. It's just that soaps &amp; other solvents makes the work far easier.\n\nSo I don't doubt that this product may work as advertised. But I do doubt, I can get more than one clean window from a single towel, and I doubt it would be any more efficient than a bucket of terry cloth towels, and I doubt I would find using this product easier or more efficient than that traditional ammonia &amp; throw away paper-towel method.	1341254534

&gt; Just a Brit/US English thing... in the UK, "mentalist" is slang for someone with a psychiatrist disorder or who acts crazily. We get the show "The Mentalist" over here, but all the same, that's not what we think of when we call someone a "mentalist".\n\nWhat a load of bollocks. Firstly, stage mentalism is an established British tradition, just because you haven't heard of something, doesn't automatically mean it's an American import. Secondly, I've never heard any one other than Alan Partridge use it as a substitute for "mental".\n\nMentalism has a long British tradition, but the word hasn't been used much in recent years, possibly because our most famous modern mentalist (Derren Brown) says he doesn't like the term, and doesn't use it to describe himself.\n\nIf you're interested, in educating yourself, I'd suggest watch the BBC's History of Magic episode on Mentalism. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHWgWNXveY	1315294927
I mean that the hypothetical gov't branch would have to be a very busy one with a lot of resources. (That could be done if you throw enough budget at it.) You'd also have to agree on maximal time frames within which the observational data would need to be gathered and evaluated in order to make decisions based on them. Is there a constant? Does it vary, depending on the nature of the "thing" analyzed? What constitutes success or failure? With some things that's relatively easy to answer, with others not at all. After all, it's not just about black-and-white scientific facts; especially with "soft sciences", sociology etc., I see a lot of potential for disagreement.\n\nAgain, I'd welcome some sort of working solution, but I think it would be far from perfect.	1343924859

In reality, if we were speaking to each other, I think this would be a good conversation, minus our childish antics...lol. OK, the issue at hand, the reason I feel so strongly is because I do know about this Guy and his history, as I have been in the UFO field for nineteen years now and I have read a lot about a lot of folks. Granted, there have been a lot of false deathbed confessions and you could say that some have done it for fame or for legacy, who knows. I just know this man was a no nonsense individual and was known to be "a geek" for lack of a better word. He was very scientific and documented all of his work to an annoying degree for his coworkers. It's really too much for me to type, but sure, his could be a lie too, and if so, then it's a real shame. I know you are just saying to have a healthy amount of skepticism and I agree with you.\n\nShit, I can't stand it when people equate ALL UFOs to ETs...it drives me nuts haha. A UFO is just that, unidentified flying object. OK I'm rambling here. Look, check out a few things for me, get or download the book called "UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government officials Go On Record by Leslie Kean", it's a great book. Also keep an eye on ufocasebook dot com and ufocenter dot com. Read some reports. Again, if his confession is a lie, shame on him, but too much is pointing to it being a good confession in my eyes. Again, I'm sorry too, I'll make it up to you. 	1334119216
It's exactly that lack of harmony with Mother Earth that was my point, perhaps I could clarify a little further. For example, if an ET race were to find that humans are being destroyed by another, potentially hostile race, then stepping in and lending a hand may be warranted, much like we humans step in when a species here on earth is being driven to extinction by something like pollution. However, if said ET race were to find us in the unfortunate process of self-destruction, as we currently appear to be doing, then they may be forbidden from providing aid, much as a scientist here on earth would be forbidden from helping a species dying out due to a simple lack of adaptability. Just a thought...	1352888809

Then again, I have had dreams of all kinds of unlikely circumstances and events.\n\n*Dreams*	1351623827

Having owned a Rott, and having had friends with Rotts, they are actually VERY sweet and gentle dogs.  They are rather possessive, perhaps that is where the stereotype comes from, but ultimately, they are a product of how they were reared.  \n\nPitt Bulls are also rather gentle, but there is one thing you need to be aware of with a Pitt Bull, they have a genetic disorder that effects whatever percentage (I do not know the number on the top of my head, but I know it is more than a simple few) that can best be described as lock jaw.  Regardless of their behaviour patterns or temperment, they can quickly and easily lock up when doing something simple as playing, leading to the mob mentality that they are aggressive.  This is not true, it is years of genetic breeding that has caused a flaw, resulting in a very sad plight for them.\n\nThat being said, I would never own a Pitt Bull.  I have been around many, and have found all of them to be absolute sweet hearts.  But I can not trust them with my child due to this genetic flaw that causes their jaws to become death traps when even they least expect it.\n\nSource: Me--having breed, trained, and taken in over 300 dogs in 29 years.	1333585225

I dunno man, I watched the whole series. He doesn't seem like the kind of guy - especially since he spent the prior 7 episodes ridiculing pretty much every religion. Before Bob did the 'exorcism', he spent a long time giving John suggestions via a very lengthy 'personality test', which I'm sure preloaded John with specific thoughts of 'demons' and the bad things he'd done and had remorse for and whatnot. The relentless and methodical nature of the 'exorcism' makes me think that Bob is just an expert hypnotist and he preys on people using his skills.	1285339746

I believe there is some pretty compelling evidence that we are being observed (but I'm not sold 100%). If this is true, I see no evidence that these "extra-terrestrials" are looking to initiate contact with man kind.  To me, it would appear that they're taking more of a biologist approach, "observe but don't interfere".  Or perhaps our collective consciousnesses is not ready to accept what the existence of extra-terrestrials would imply to meaning-of-life views, and they are being polite.  Regardless, I see the metaphorical ball in their court. If they are out there, and want to have contact, they will initiate it.  	1345571709

Honestly, this comes across as quite condescending. It's also sort of logic defying because your statement seems to be "don't just take things at face value" but you start off by saying "take what I'm saying at face value...it's *all* humans." I don't know how you reached this conclusion. \n\nVarious groups have come forward and they can replicate some of the phenomena...not all of it. Within the most interesting crop circles there are phenomena that would be difficult for humans to replicate: microwave radiation, the depositing of iron within the circle, and actual changes to the plant itself. \n\nA few years back an MIT group did research on several circles and verified these aspects. I don't doubt that humans could create the designs but in conjunction with these other elements I think other explanations come into play. \n\nAlso, "Fox News" is becoming like the new "Hitler" in internet debate. The same things that make that network's journalism so tedious exist in all the other major networks. I think we'd both agree that consulting multiple choices on an issue is important.	1345205171

Notice that I took the shot with flash, too, as many "orb photos" are.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the farther the particle from the lens' focus length, the more aggressive the bokeh will be.

In all honesty, i don't think disclosure, in the form of statements from the heads of states on the planet, will happen. Ever.\nIf anything happens, it'll be the stereotypical landing on the front lawn of the White House or somewhere else equally as prominent to announce their arrival.\nThink of what full disclosure would mean to our society, right now, or even in a few decades time.\nThink of what disclosure would do to religion on Earth...\nChristianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism. Do you think these religions would be able to accept it? I think not!\nThe pope once sidestepped a question about aliens by simply saying that if there were other beings on other planets, then they were also probably made by God.\nSounds like the Catholics have been preparing for a while now, but for the millions of other religious people? How do you think they would react?\nThe world would be in chaos and not a very nice place to be...\n\nJust my thoughts on the matter.	1340727764

A note is an octave higher than another purely because it has a frequency that is doubled.\n\nIt is true that the scales we use now are based on what people thought sounded good, and what people are now used to, but even using some eastern scales - containing 15, 17 or 24 notes - the octave of any note will always be double the original and any octave will span double the frequency of the octave below it.\n\nMaybe that's more physics based now that I think about it but it seems close enough for me. 	1278681853

If there really is an image in the window in real life, this phenomenon is [pareidolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia). \n\nIf you hadn't been told that it was supposed to be Diana, you wouldn't have seen her. The suggestion has been planted before you even see the footage.\n\n20 years ago, especially if you were Catholic, you might think it was the Virgin Mary. Or you might think it was Marilyn Monroe, or whoever.\n\nIt's more likely that the video is doctored. \n\nHere's why: we're not told what church in Glasgow this is, because we could then go and *look at the stained glass design* and compare it. The fact that the location is not mentioned is a bit of a give away that this is a beat-up, and so is the fact that it is being used in a TV show. The people doing the filming are also conveniently anonymous.\n\nThe video is so poor in resolution that there's no way to tell what is really on the glass in real life, but the image of Diana at one point suddenly gets clear and crisp, which suggests a superimposition. You can't improve a low resolution piece of footage in that way.\n\nThe movement of the camera looks like an editing job, too, does not appear like hand held movement, but more like the simulation of shaky cam from some video editing software. \n\nWhy would a ghost would manifest itself in a static image in a place that has only a tangential connection with their life? If you had that ability, wouldn't you manifest in some much more visible and recognisable location?	1327906510

I'm just gonna start by saying you need to do more research and think critically about this subject before jumping into the "Let's all write a petition to submit to the government" as a briefing doc sort of thing.  To begin with, your terms are all confused and your meanings are unclear.  You need to define what exactly is meant by "prove the existence of UFO's" (sic), what type of investigation are you proposing?  When you say you want to "spearhead" the document but don't want to be a leader, what are you saying?\n\nTo think that one document alone, or one research project, or one unified voice can make a difference is admirable.  We all have to have passion in this subject if we want to see any headway in what amounts to disclosure of information about *already government verified and studied* Unidentified Flying Objects, which is what you are really talking about here.  Take them to task about what is already acknowledged and go from there (as Leslie Kean has suggested).\nGood luck, young padawan.	1321977588

&gt; These could all be studied further\n\nThey could be, and that's the whole point, they should be studied further. However, none of the many obvious questions will be answered if it's continued to be ridiculed, marginalized and poorly understood.\n\n&gt; nobody actually in support of UFOs is doing real, verifiable research\n\nI beg to differ. There are many folks involved in ufology who are doing real, verifiable research such as [Leslie Kean](https://www.facebook.com/lesliekean), [Richard Dolan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Dolan), (arguably) Robert Hastings, [Stanton Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_T._Friedman), and [Jacques Vallée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%C3%A9e). There have been other, well-respected researchers who have since passed such as [Dr. J Allen Hynek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek), [John E. MacDonald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._McDonald) and [Major Donald Keyhoe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Keyhoe).\n\nYou're also prematurely assuming that UFOs and crop circles have any sort of connection, which I personally don't believe they do. At least there's no evidence to connect the two phenomena.	1312562456

I think of atheism as being sort of a natural consequence of a skeptical and naturalistic worldview which values empiricism.  Rightly there's an awful *lot* of things that I don't believe in, or remain unconvinced of, but there is some reasonable standard of evidence which could convince me of any given claim's truthfulness.  The fact that we have a term for *not* believing in this certain claim about the existence of deities is more a sign of the cultural weight we give to that particular idea, not that atheism is itself so radical or an entire world-view.	1335427269

Absolutely, Zelda was not the most important thing, it was just a conduit for those ideas. But the reason why I think it was such a good one is because it was in this isolated sandbox. \n\nMost people are heavily influenced by the beliefs of their family and others around them, usually learning that whatever their parents think must be true and carrying on the same ideas. Anything with real-world applications is very subject to biases based on social/cultural influences, and we have to overcome those biases and prejudices in order to think properly. (That in itself is an indicator of what I think is the most fucked up thing about modern society, that everyone learns the exact opposite of the right way to think and are never told that this is wrong, leading to much prejudice, discrimination and hatred.) \n\nOf course, people going into things with biases still happened in indirect ways, but this was an excellent way to learn these skills without also forming or utilising any beliefs on major issues debated in the real world - better to do that later, *after* discovering the pitfalls. The consequences rarely extended further than the games themselves, while the consequences of political/economic/religious/scientific/moral arguments can be far-reaching and can obscure the actual point of the debate. (Though appeals to emotion and consequences still popped up sometimes, in the most pants-on-head-retarded ways.)\n\nAs a bonus, it also helped me hone my understanding of how to analyse a story, and the themes and intent behind that story, which applies in some really interesting ways in the Zelda series - such as where gameplay and plot themes tie together. (The Wind Waker is the big one there, and other games, like The Minish Cap, also have interesting thematic elements which play into their timeline placements.)	1295491050

&gt; That's irrelevant: such sweeping changes to crop production will incur massive costs.\n\nYa, except I run a farm so I can confidently say, it's really not that big a deal. I grow literally dozens of of different crops at any given time.\n\nThe only people that freaks out are the really big agribusiness's and their monocultures. The corn belt will have to diversify but they will have to anyway for other reasons.\n\n&gt; It's not really that reasonable when you just play on words and dismiss the literature off-hand without providing peer-reviewed research on your own.\n\nWhat you see as a play on words is me pointing out the fact that you are asking me to freak out about something that is inherently unpredictable. We have two knowns, 1) overall warming and 2) rising sea levels. The rest, the details that will make the most important impacts are impossible to foresee and I refuse to freak out over invisible boogiemen that might make my crops wither or might make them shine with 50/50 odds.\n\nAs for the peer reviewed research, I'm commenting from the perspective of an actual farmer at the moment but I used to work in drug discovery so I'm pretty good at reading research papers. As a farmer, I'm intimately engaged with things like temperature and rainfall as a normal part of what I do.\n\nIf there is a particular, specific paper you wish to discuss please link and we can go over it.\n\nI'm looking at the same research you are, and can tell you with great confidence, exactly what would happen to me and my ability to produce food under those scenarios.\n\nFor example, take a hypothetical 3C increase in temperature where I'm at. Summers would be too hot for leafy greens but I'd be able to grow early spring tomatoes which I can't do now. Corn would be planted a full month or more early and could take advantage of the winter rains where currently I have to irrigate. I could probably even plant tropical corns that are photo-period sensitive to provide access to fresh Choclo to local Peruvian restaurants. I'd be able to overwinter rocotos. Basically it would be as if you picked up my farm and moved it to San Diego, it would require some change to the way I do things, but overall, it's not real scary.\n\nThe one question for me here in this specific senario is, what happens to rainfall. If it increases that's a wonderful thing, if it decreases california agriculture would dry up, but it's that very specific kind of thing that is not predictable.\n\nOn a side note, 18k years ago, the mojave desert extended all the way up to Livermore CA, that's change.\n\n&gt; I don't use sockpuppets, but we probably reacted this way at the same time because it doesn't seem that you're debating in good faith.\n\nI've replied in good faith to every point either of you have posted, you just don't like my answers. 	1348468163

Based on symptoms, upper esophogeal pain without any lower gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nGluten irritates the lining in the duodenum or lower, not the esophagus. Placing a piece of wheat "under the tongue" is a ridiculous way to diagnosis someone. \n\nGluten has been latched onto by new-age types as yet another universal malady. However, it has very specific effects, none of which the OP is exhibiting. \n\nIf I had to take a guess, the OP is suffering from an ulcer. \n\nWhatever it is, the OP needs to visit their general practitioner. If that doesn't give answers, make an appointment with a gastroenterologist.	1331511263

Their *revealed* belief is that it isn't going to end.	1338259636

in parallel reality theory it would be possible to experience one side of an event and then zap back to the split and experience the other. the soul contains both experiences, however our memory can only function in a linear fashion.

As I keep trying to say:\n\n1. You've invented the terms "explicit institutional sexism" and "implicit institutional sexism". \n\n2. Institutional sexism is defined as what you are calling explicit institutional sexism\n\n3. You start telling me I disagree with a concept just because I think you are calling that concept by the wrong word: \n\n&gt; I explain that I don't think it's reasonable to discount implicit institutional sexism as a part of institutional sexism\n\nWho gives a shit if you think the common usage of word is "reasonable", that's when I said you were making normative judgments about word definitions. That's how people use the word. That's how it's defined in dictionaries, normally "argument by dictionary" is not a good argument, except in the case of arguing about what the common meaning of a word is.\n\n&gt;  argue that it's better understood as "cultural bias" or "sexism"\n\nNOT "understood as", I was saying "defined as"\n\nI also went to great lengths to point out that I do not disagree that that type of sexism is prevalent or with your other points.\n\n4. The social institutions part\n\nI say: "I guess if you count social institutions I can see why you would group what you call "implicit institutional sexism" as a type of institutional sexism, but I think that's a stretch, and as I said before that's just called "sexism". \n\nI said this because I was trying to figure out what type of sexism you were talking about. \n\nThen instead of you saying "no, i'm not talking about social institutions, i'm talking about endemic sexism in institutions that is still entrenched and is not covered by anti discrimination laws nor by the simple label of "sexism" because ..." you think I'm arguing the opposite of my point and say basically the same thing back to me about it being a stretch.\n\nIt's as if we were both working stocking shelves in a supermarket and you started to put the pickles on the shelf labeled olives. I say "that's the wrong shelf, the label says "olives" and you say "how can you not like pickles! they are delicious"\n\nCan you blame me for thinking you were trolling me?	1348248910

Well, it's terribly unfortunate that you are offended so easily.  The internet is full of reasons to be offended, unless you realize that not everything is to be taken so damn seriously.  Your group of friends from Africa can rest knowing that they aren't the only people that are 'bundled' up in stereotypes, there are plenty to go around, and the internet is the best place to find it all.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Chill the fuck out.  \n\nActually, I didn't bundle your many friends from Africa into a stereotype at all, I bundled only the tribes that ran around naked covered in bone and cock jewelery into a stereotype.  The internet will offend you if you let it, I was only making a comment, I wasn't writing an essay claiming that all black people eat each other.  \n\nI doubt, by the way, that your friends would be anything but embarrassed that you claim to be 'defending' them by telling me how offended you are that I called an ancient tribe from Africa cannibals in a comment thread about a David Icke video where he claims that they were all raped by reptiles from a different planet.\n	1324139426

Maybe. Maybe it's all bullshit. But it's fun and exciting bullshit for the people who go through or do this stuff. Take it as a new brand of mysticism for a technological age. Difference being, this is like a myth that is all based on personal experience and evidence, while most other spiritual beliefs of the past were pretty heavy on the dogma and intolerance while not having much by way of evidence or value for the individual.\n\nOr maybe our perceptions limit us from being aware of certain things, things like dimensions other intelligences might call home. It'd be pretty hard to convince society that you dreamed the color red and know what it looks like if everyone lacked eyes. That doesn't mean the wavelength somehow wouldn't exist though.\n\nTake it for what you will. I'm not putting any stock in an explanation for now, the truth could be anywhere here.	1329262666

You obviously only implement skepticism as far as society's boundaries allow you, so whatever form of skepticism is the accepted around here it must be some branch I missed out on because I thought it  only referred to the use of critical analysis, observation of facts and ability to see beyond face values.\n\nYou're going to scoff at this no doubt and scoff away at the end of the day our paths will probably never cross again but this **really** does apply to people who exhibit the type of mindset you are displaying [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEGgAk1AbA4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEGgAk1AbA4)	1339029499

I'm sure I remember seeing a documentary about cold fusion being successful but on an incredibly miniscule scale that wasn't even remotely useful.

I'm going to take the easiest stand in the world:\n\nWe will never cure aging. Death will remain a part of the human existence until such a time as the ability to transfer the thoughts and ideas of humans into a non-living platform becomes possible - something that is similarly not-too-difficult to argue against as a possibility of existence.\n\nFor a forum of skeptics, the number of upvotes and downvotes on these last two posts is indicative of a miserably uneducated lot.\n\nEdit: for the inevitable reference to a 9th-grade-biology-level understanding of aging - telomeres are not the only, nor even the most important, biochemical aspect of aging needing to be addressed. Please... please don't try to bring up something you learned about in high school.\n\nUntil the perpetual motion machine is invented, my posts are accurate, and my only current reply is wishful thinking.	1354055933

Sometimes it seems as if she never died and when I wake up I remember the awful truth of what really happened.  \n\nI don't think it's weird to see her in my dreams.  In fact it makes me feel happy to see her in my dreams even if there is a chance I am going to be disappointed when I wake up.

Ok, good answer.\n\nNow, who is the person going through this process? And if it's not a person but a computer, who programs this computer to make these decisions to run the process in the way that you wrote? \n\nChances are that that person would take a totally different approach than you. Let's say, they might look at the nutritional needs of the people who go to restaurants Instead, or maybe he would look at what is underused in the food supply and try to use it. Even if 2 people used similar data, they would probably implement it differently. \n\nThis is obvious to anyone who's done computer programming and looked at other peoples' code. Different people take wildly different approaches to solving problems. Some work better than others which is why some software is good and some sucks. It all depends on the myriad of choices made while writing it.\n\nNow, assume the guy writing this software is corrupt- how do you deal with that? Maybe he writes a program to put as many restaurants as possible in an area whos restaurants are controlled by his buddy who takes the food and sells it on the black market to a non-rbe country? Or maybe he just programs it to favor his locations near his house? This is what happened in the USSR, and without any safeguards it would happen here too. People are always trying to game the system for their own benefit. How will you guard against it? Without some laws to guarantee against such behavior and someone to enforce them, it is sure to exist- at least it has in every other society since the dawn of time.	1317116711

Both 1/3 and 1/2 are true; they're different answers to slightly different questions.  The puzzle exploits the subtle and easy to overlook difference between those two questions (as many such puzzles do) in order to make it into a cool puzzle for people to argue about.\n\nThe answer to "what is the probability you chose the right door and should not switch?" is indeed 1/3 (therefore you should switch).  But the answer to "what is the probability that the door he is offering you has the car, BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME?" is 1/2.  And this is where the puzzle becomes a trick.\n\nSuppose someone walked into the room, who was in an isolation booth during the beginning part where there were three doors and then one got removed.  He doesn't know about the three original doors and they are hidden from his view.  He takes your place in the game, and takes over your situation with the two remaining doors.  His odds are now, pretty clearly, 1/2.  He had nothing to do with the original choice, so the 1/3 is irrelevant.  He either has the car, or he doesn't.\n\nThis also applies to the original contestant; he either has the car, or he doesn't.  So 1/2 is a legit answer.  But with the original info supplied by Monty, he should still switch in every trial, because he knows that 2/3 of the time he is switching away from the shitty prize.\n\n**TL,DR;** It's a trick question, designed to get people yelling at each other.	1297163581

I believe there's some evidence that aspartame (NutraSweet) increases insulin production, even though it's not adding to glucose in the blood stream. If you're worried about maintaining insulin sensitivity (which is probably a good idea) it might be good to avoid it. Sucralose isn't supposed to have this effect, although I personally hate how it leaves a sweet taste in the mouth for hours afterward due to saliva enzymes not being able to break it down.\n\nThe acid in the soda is probably a bigger worry, as it seriously affects dental health and may lead to digestive issues like acid reflux and inflammation. I think diet sodas in general have also been linked to weight gain (not just correlated with being fat, which would seem natural). In large quantities, the occasional conversion of aspartame into methanol (at higher temperatures) can become a problem too.	1294246210

&gt;I've heard repeated that we actually do produce enough food to feed the entire world population, but if that's the case, there's some major disconnect in getting the food where it needs to go, and that's what needs changed.\n\nThis is exactly the issue. When people are starving there is always a group of people holding the food hostage. The problem is what to do about that - do we send in military to fight the rebels stealing the food? Do we stay out of all of it? Do we pick and choose? Who pays for this? Those questions and deciding the answers to them are often what truly holds up getting food to the starving people.	1333324631

Excellent points all, original and the edit. Thank you. It is blinded as far as I know (the patient has to go get the "remedy" and it will either be a placebo or not). Not sure what the null hypothesis is, but I can find out easily. \nOne of my big concerns is that families participating in the study would have to alter the protocol that we already use. For example, we do suggest two herbal remedies (well known in the lactation world) via capsule in the first month when prolactin levels are already high. The study demands that they take the herbs via tea, not capsules, which I'm not sure would be as effective. I'm not a big fan of the herbs to begin with (6-8 capsules tid; that's a meal!) but they can be effective sometimes. If they don't work, we prescribe a medication that boosts prolactin levels. This is in concert with working on latch, feeding management, and addressing issues such as tongue tie. \nIssues such as how baby latches at the breast can be major, and it varies greatly how well families make adjustments when they go home. So, for example, perhaps a mom does a great job changing the latch at home and therefore experiences better milk flow, whereas another mom still has challenges changing her latch. Would this not have an impact on whether the "remedy" has had an effect? The mind boggles.	1342795279

If he says nothing to his family he fails them. If this also makes it easier for them to dodge or minimize the consequences of their actions, he also fails society and the justice system. I understand he is under no obligation. This is similar to a criminals mother not giving him up out of some twisted sense of loyalty regardless of his crimes or their nature. Similar, not necessarily in severity but through the act of indifference on one of the involved parties.  \n\nWhy let them weasel out of the consequences, and feign ignorance. They need money,they may not even be ignorant of it being a scam, merely willing to take peoples money because it is easy, and at least to themselves, personally justifiable.\n\nI too would be rooting for the plaintiff regardless.	1304015460
&gt;No they don't, no they don't. There is absolutely no evidence to show that,\n\nI'm on my mobile at the moment so I can't find links however wikipedia has some good stats and the like. Countries with more stringent gun controls in general have a much lower gun crime homicide rate per population unit. There are a few countries here and there that break that trend on both sides of the coin but in general that seems to be the case and in essence it makes sense, if there is less of X around then usage of X will be less. Please note that I said less *gun related* violent crime and not violent crime in general. \n\n&gt;but besides that everyone knows that first of all you need weapons to protect from government tyranny, then defense from buglers and stuff and then you can use your weapon for hunting\n\nThat's personal opinion. While this has been the case in the last year or so in places such as Egypt, Lybia, etc these are very different countries to those in the Western world and I think the battleground against tyranny in places such as the US is political &amp; not at gunpoint. Having said that, it's another conversation altogether and as I previously mentioned, I'm not saying that you should repeal the 2nd.\n\n&gt;You just said it yourself, people kill and not guns and there is no way to stop acts of violence, I mean if it isn't guns its going to be homemade bombs and then you'd probably have even bigger casualties.\n\nThat's a big jump to make, no guns "Better make a bomb!". Yeah, a couple might but I'd think it's much more likely that they grab a knife or try and beat the crap out of someone with a baseball bat. \n\n&gt;You can not make the world completely safe, I mean its just impossible, if you want to be completely safe lock yourself up in one room and never leave, even then you are probably just going to die actually sooner from heart attack because of lack of exercise and sun, so going out and having a 0.000001% chance of dying from a gun shot is a lot smaller than 25% chance to die from heart attack within 1 year of inactivity.\n\nWhat, I don't even? Where did this paragraph even come from. Suggesting tighter controls for a deadly weapon ≠ suggesting we all stay inside. Not even close. \n\n&gt;So whatever way you look at it guns are not the issue and shouldn't be an issue and should never be discussed and governments never allowed to restrict guns, because when they do you have government tyranny.\n\nGovernments banning gun ownership causes them to auto flip to being tyrannical, got it! \n\nThe US is doing it how it would like to and I'm not suggesting they take gun ownership away from the masses because I think as a country you're far and away beyond the point of no return for that to work. What I am trying to get across is that there are other countries that do restrict gun ownership, it DOESN'T make them tyrannical and it does on average seem to have a positive effect on gun based crime stats. \n\nI'm not going to argue/reply any further as it's gotten to a point where all that is on each side of this argument is your belief that gun ownership is a basic human right of some sort and me believing that it isn't. There are many people like each of us on both sides of this argument and at the end of the day all we're likely to achieve here is to repeat old threads, blow a lot of hot air around and have some people in subreddit drama laugh in our direction. I think it's better if we just leave it at this, we can shake hands and agree to disagree.	1343138225

I never had an experiance personally but I used to work in a resort in The Smokey Mountians that had it's fair share of suicides and murders. There is one suite that no one in the two years I worked there stayed the whole night in. It's not a rule but the manager will tell you that it's the very last room you should book.\n\nAbout a year before I started working there a man brought his pregnant wife in and ended up murdering her then hanging himself. The hotel closed the suite for awhile and compleately remodeled it. They even changed the room numbers around to prevent people from seeking out the room.\n\nStill everyone that we put in it ,and a friend and I would often put people in it, no one stayed in it the whole night. They would check out in the middle of the night or would come down to the desk and demand another room. Most people wouln't give a reason but the few we got were people kept hearing a baby/woman crying, seeing a woman in the room, hearing voices, being touched, and having items moved around.\n\nI've heard they don't even book the room at all anymore and have turned it into storeage.\n\n	1339443019

You have asserted that people who are anti-GMO are generally ignorant of the benefits of GMOs.\n\nYou have demonstrated, as the entirety of your evidence, that two people out of the entire set of people who are actively against GMOs, are ignorant of the benefits of GMOs.  \n\nYou have not demonstrated that the over 2.9 million members of Greenpeace, an organization which actively blocks distribution of Golden Rice because it is an Evil GMO, are ignorant of the benefits.  \n\nYou have put forth anecdotal evidence about a couple of know-nothings in your family.

Some strains of influenza (e.g. bird flu) appear to preferentially kill people in the 15 - 50 age bracket  instead of the elderly (like normal strains), and it's suspected that people in that age bracket die *because they have a strong immune system*. Too many immune cells are sent to the infection triggering a [cytokine storm](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-cytokine-storm.htm).\n\nIgnoring bird flu, the immune system is a balance - there are disorders at both ends of the scale, and even thinking about it like a scale or 'general strength' is wrong because the way it reacts to something depends on what it's been exposed to in the past.	1291909517
That's so original and unexpected!... however, "proven beyond a shadow of a doubt" does not include visions, it includes several witnesses.

Mweh, this again.\n\nThe assumption that certain frequencies cause certain feelings are to be approached with similar skepticism as the ghostly things they are used for to explain. Sound frequencies especially. There is no other way to enter the brain other than physical resonance, which may or may not occur at any frequency. This will be different for each person. It will never be absolute.\n\nAlso the "20Hz" thing gives this away. Humans are relatively deaf for low frequencies. We here best at ±4000 Hz, and the lower it gets, the more deaf we are for it. An airco may produce 70 dB SPL around 60 Hz without being loud, but if it were to produce a whine at that sound pressure level around 4000 Hz, you'd turn it off right away.\n\nThis deafness does not start at 20Hz exactly. Your subwoofer needs to be really big to produce 20 to 40Hz audibly, not because the waves are so large (20Hz is 17.5 meters!) but because it needs to move a lot of air, because you are too deaf to hear it otherwise. This deafness is a curve, and it's different for everybody. I bet a large speaker and a big amp can produce 19Hz at an SPL that most people can hear.\n\nThat said, I do get very dizzy and uneasy when my GF ventilation system is on. It has very low audio components at a loud volume.	1318701542

You don't have to reserve judgement until you watched it. One video should not change your mind anyway. just to interest you. And to show that this is serious business. Not something you just dismiss on a frikkin beach in 20 seconds.\n\nThere have been many talented people studied, some showed significant results.\nJames Randi is not a scientist, he is a lying magician who's entire life is devoted to debunking at all costs. If you want truth for him, you might as well believe in fairy-tales. JREF's price is a showpiece. Even if someone actually did made a successful go at it, the contract is so that JREF can get out of it. There is tons of that on the internet, some stories truly outrageous.\n	1316224774
Fair points. And yes, there is a huge difference between having evidence that there is unexplained phenomena and saying they are coming from other planets. What annoys me though is debunkers who dismiss evidence of the phenomena itself and come up with prosaic reasons that are quite ridiculous, for example the so called sceptic who dismisses the Rendlesham Forest case saying that it was probably lights from a lighthouse when we have the audio recording of the army base officer describing the UFO that was on the ground in front of them and left radiation traces.	1346501137

&gt;Indeed - thankfully, we have much more factual data than you are aware of.\n\nI'm speaking specifically of the data used for their animation, which does not match reality.  They data that they refuse to release in freedom of information request.\n\n&gt;We know the location and severity of the damage to the structure itself.\n\nReally?  Of WTC7?  I would love to see how you know this damage that they talk about.\n\n&gt;Your picture isn't taking in to account that the exterior structure of the building was separate from the interior structure.\n\nThat's complete nonsense.  If the corner columns were gone, you would notice it.  The corner would be gone.  I talked to structural engineers that do research for NIST, and they don't even suggest that.  They say it's just a model, that is not accurate, but explains what could have happened.\n\n&gt;&gt;Do you know that NIST has refused multiple FOIA request to release the data behind their animation?\n\n&gt;I was unaware of that. Have they given a reason why?\n\nYeah, you are going to love this.  They say, the release of the documents "might jeopardize public safety."  No shit!  Read it here:\n\nhttp://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf\n\n&gt;You're jumping to conclusions. You've gone from what should have been a "Hmm, why aren't they releasing the data" data point A to "CONSPIRACY!!!!" data point Z without filling in B through Y in the middle.\n\nI'm fairly well researched in this area.  Saying they won't release the data models for "public safety" reasons suggest a coverup to me.  Simulations are for science; animations are for marketing.  Right now, giving the facts we know, this is an animation, and the dataset would likely show fraud by NIST in their report.	1315571923

See, now I respectfully disagree with this idea. \n\n&gt;I believe we are not alone in the universe, btu the odds of us making contact with any other intelligent lifeforms is so small we probably never will. \n\nI think this, in itself, says that it's very likely. I saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/YWthu.jpg) and it kind of put things in perspective. Now mind you, I knew a good portion of this already (and being at a [6] might have helped a bit), but just looking at how vast the universe is, and understanding that we know fuckall about what's out there, I think contact is virtually inevitable.\n\nI have a theory that maybe for every 2 or 3 solar systems there can only be one planet with life. But then, who know how big each particular solar system is? Just what I think.	1316565578

As i've said in another thread from this post, I would generally agree with you.

That I definitely disagree with. It's all about perception.

When my granddad was still alive, he used to get a forewarning of somebody's death. Occasionally, he would hear a knocking sound.

Apparently, the knocks were louder when it was a person who was close to my granddad.  \n   \nMy mum told me this years ago, but I can't really explain it. Maybe something along the lines of conformation bias.

The earth! \n\nBasically, AC can be used to send power through only one conductor if you have two large capacitances at the ends. \n\nImagine a circle of tubing filled with water, with a pump and a turbine lying across from each other on this circle of tubing. The pump can pump water through the tubing, which turns the turbine, and the water comes back through the tubing to the pump.\n\nNow, cut the tubing between the pump and turbine, and put water-filled balloons at the ends. If you turn the pump on, the turbine will turn for a while, but one balloon will have the water pumped out and one balloon will get filled up. Eventually, the negative pressure from the empty balloon and the positive pressure from the full balloon will overwhelm the pump, and the turbine will stop turning.\n\nBut... what if you have the pump switch directions regularly? Now one balloon will start to fill and the other will start to empty, but before the pressures can overwhelm the pump the pump *switches directions*! The turbine, then, will move back and forth. You've transmitted power through through only one piece of tubing (conductor)! The water balloons are the capacitances, providing a temporary storage place for the extra "water" (charge) that sloshes back and forth.\n\nYou can try this at home (if you have a Tesla coil at home, of course :P): Touch your Tesla coil and hold only one lead of a LED. The LED lights up! This is because of the inherent capacitance of the LED leads and the semiconductor junction in the LED. With low-frequency (say, mains), the LED won't light. The pump doesn't switch directions fast enough, and it gets overwhelmed by the pressures before it switches.	1353361017

Yes, I got the cheekiness. Just wanted to point out that Ms. Watson is correct in her "assertion" as it does exist in legislation (though not in all states AFAIK). It is also in FBI's definition of rape, and in the rules of many colleges and universities, just for an example see UNH's Student Code of Conduct: http://www.unh.edu/sharpp/consent\n\n"Can someone consent to having sex if they are intoxicated?  \n**No.** Once a person is intoxicated by alcohol and/or other drugs, she/he cannot legally give consent, even if she/he appears to give consent or verbally says “yes.”  \nIf someone you are with is having difficulty walking or talking, is throwing up, passed out, or just generally unaware of what’s going on, that person cannot legally give consent."\n\nAnd if there's no consent it's rape or sexual assault. \n\nJust felt that that's important to point out as there seemed to be some confusion about this among skeptics. And as you can see from the link in my previous post confusion about this rather simple thing can have very serious consequences indeed.\n\nEDIT: Here's another example, this former economics major at Texas A&amp;M University (and a serial rapist) is now serving 18 years: http://www.publicintegrity.org/2010/02/26/4404/undetected-rapists-campus-troubling-plague-repeat-offenders\n\n&gt;By the time it was over, there would be a total of five women, all testifying they were assaulted by Yarbrough in the same circumstances: After drinking heavily, each said she passed out or fell asleep and woke to find Yarbrough having sex with her or touching her sexually.  “He would pick the most intoxicated female, whether he’d be at a bar or at a party,” recalled Lt. Brandy Norris, the lead investigator on the case for College Station police. “He’s a serial rapist. He was smart enough to know he didn’t have to hide in the bushes and grab them as they were walking by.”\n\nHere's couple of examples of how these guys operate: [WWYD? - Unscripted Scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=QUKCWT05LWA)	1356084234
&gt; we tried that on early reddit and it became dominated by "vote up if bush should be impeached."\n\nA bit OT, but as one old-timer to another - I'd completely forgotten about those "vote up if ..." style posts.  I haven't seen one in a while.  Good riddance.  I'm an unapologetic get-off-my-grass curmudgeon - I automatically downvote any imgur link.  I reserve the (rarely exercised) option to un-downvote in case the image content was somehow substantial.\n\nThat said, when I joined Reddit, the upvote / downvote mechanism was supposed to help Reddit customize your front page - it meant "show me more/fewer items like this" - sort of like the Netflix recommendation engine.  I really liked the potential of being introduced to new topics based on interest.  It never worked all that well, unfortunately, so I suppose I don't mind having to manually choose my own subreddits.	1317496813

I found what I consider to be a very accurate review of his book on goodreads.com: \n\n"Terrible. Here's the book in a nutshell. "I'm in &lt;3rd world country&gt; doing &lt;something bad not backed up by any statistics&gt;. I feel bad about this. I meet &lt;friendly 3rd world local who teaches me the local language&gt;. He takes me to &lt;cultural festivity that no other white man has ever seen&gt;. I learn &lt;specific critique of US imperialism&gt;. I return to my out of touch american enclave and happen upon &lt;famous dictator/dissident/writer&gt;. He &lt;describes the country's forthcoming assasination/revolution/economic degregation&gt; like a prophet." The process then repeats. \n\n\nAnyway, I'm sure the ideas in this book will help some 19 year old get laid. and if you are that 19 year old then I can not recommend this book highly enough."	1278041565

I have to check since I think it was a different term from anthropic principle which concerns more the appearance of the universe to beings evolved to live in it.

I believe that something extraordinary happened in the woods outside of Bentwaters AFB in late 1980.

It speaks of Hy Brasil which is a supposed Atlanian-type  island that sank off the coast of Ireland.  It really is quite ridiculous and harms the honest testimony of witnesses like Halt. 	1347923625

This is basically the entire basis for the r/conspiracy subreddit.  I've never encountered as much pure, unadulterated confirmation bias as I have there.  In addition to confirmation bias, there's a fair amount of circlejerking - that is to say, one conspiracy theorist quotes another who quotes another, and then claims this as a credible source.  \n\nNot to mention the hilarious dismissal; if you don't agree that Jews run the world and 9/11 was an inside job, they accuse you of *only watching Fox News*...and then, on the strength of this baseless assertion, they ignore every point made in your argument.\n\n	1319266190

Cool - Sitchin was one area I knew something about, so I went straight to that and found the Biblical stuff in it.  Then I went and checked bios and websites and found a strong Christian agenda.

&gt;Did you mean to say 'skepchick' there?\n\nNo, I meant as a more accurate alternative, though maybe my view of skepchick is mostly down to what I've seen from Rebecca Watson who when I first came across her I thought was cool, sensible and a good spokeswoman for skepticism, but then I started to see too much "lol stupid religious people" type of things from her, which put me off.\n\n&gt;What issues do you think they've exaggerated?\n\nFor instance, Dawkins comment, which ended up in a call for people to not buy his books or give any attention to him. That's silly, it wasn't engaging in reasoned discussion.\n\n&gt;The FTB contain a vast range of blogs;\n\nI was talking about skepchick.com not freethoughtblogs. It'd be silly to make any general claims about FTB as it's just like wordpress as far as I know, just offering a service for a vast range of different things.\n\n&gt;As for the adverts, I might be wrong but it was my understanding that those ads are tailored towards the web user based on their history and hits, not on the site itself? Either way, I don't think the website owner chooses the ads at all, and they'd probably appreciate being told that those ads were coming up.\n\nAs far as I know the people running the websites can select what kind of ads would be displayed, not specific ads but they can select from a category. I'm using a new install of firefox at my parent's in law, so there wasn't any history.\n\n&gt;It seems fair enough to me - it's objectively true that Satoshi's conclusions stem directly from his misogyny and racism, and it makes sense to oppose him being hired by a site dedicated to intellectual topics on that basis.\n\nIt might be true that Satoshi is a misogynist and racist, I don't know enough about him as I've generally ignored him as I think he's utterly ridiculous, but if I was going to say anything about him it'd be pointing out problems with his claims and ignoring the person.\n\n&gt;What's wrong with "pornographic astronomical terms"? Most feminists don't believe there is anything inherently wrong with pornography, and most argue for the importance of having positive views of sex.\n\nWell I'm not really familiar with their views on pornography.

Maybe I'm creating a strawman image of what pornography is though?	1347957485

I'll confess to not having my head entirely wrapped around the section where Mises lays out those logical underpinnings, but I do know that was a very long and comprehensive section where he established praxeology's logical validity and the soundness of the science as a science.  I'm only on my first read, however,  and that is the area I intend to revisit first when I go through it again.   Thus far, the economics have lined up to describe and explain what i've already observed in reality, and as such, has been quite compelling.\n\nI apologize for the tone of my previous comment, since you are clearly studying the literature of this field.

OK. This is what I have found.  You can do a simple search on the W.H.O. website.\n\nhttp://search.who.int/search?q=reiki&amp;ie=utf8&amp;site=default_collection&amp;client=_en&amp;proxystylesheet=_en&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;oe=utf8\n\nAnd this seems to be typical of the type of "recommendation" that is being given.\n\nhttp://www.searo.who.int/en/section1174/section1199/section1567/section1824_8089.htm\n\n&gt; Spiritual leaders and faith healers…wisdom to action\n\n&gt; Spiritual leaders and faith healers occupy a unique position in South-East Asian societies owing to their stature, position, wisdom and their capability to influence people’s beliefs and values. While the spiritual and religious dimensions of suicides are debatable, it is essential to realize that "human life is precious". Since people have enormous faith, respect and confidence in spiritual leaders, they should emphasize the fact that suicide is preventable and individuals can be helped by counselling, medication and supportive services. Spiritual leaders can emphasize the importance of life and its meaning by promoting positive beliefs and values.\n\n&gt; **Faith healers should be involved in suicide prevention activities at the community level as they are the first level of contact for many health problems.** If they can play a positive role in identifying suicidal thoughts, behaviour, depressive states and offer emotional support to people, it will be a step in the right direction. Several non-pharmacological methods of management are gaining popularity in SEAR Member Countries. **Some of these are yoga, meditation, acupuncture and reiki. While no established randomized controlled trials are available to prove their efficacy and effectiveness in the management of certain psychological problems, their acceptance in the community has been growing. It is vital to develop a better understanding about the role of these systems to incorporate positive, harmless and culturally- accepted methods.** The involvement of spiritual leaders (imams in Bangladesh, monks in Sri Lanka and Thailand, religious leaders in India) in community decision-making activities will be of help in promoting solidarity in the community.\n\nSo what this boils down to, is that in 3rd world countries where there may not be access to full medical care, the W.H.O. with attempt to use whatever the locals use to seek treatment as an avenue to promote their agenda.  So if the W.H.O. can utilise the local faith healer to promote, condom use to prevent AIDS, or to encourage vaccination, or to use mosquito nets to prevent malaria, they will do it.  This is quite simply a practical approach.	1336243795

&gt; but in all previous cases of anarchy, crime has increased\n\nThis is not true. There's only been a few cases of anarchism, and in all of them there was less crime compared to the previous state. [Crime in Somalia went down, although there aren't a lot of statistics to go by except for the increase in trade freedom).](http://www.peterleeson.com/better_off_stateless.pdf) [Almost all of these didn't have crime either.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anarchist_communities) [Even the Kowloon Walled City had very little crime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City#Urban_settlement), outside of crime that was defined by the Hong Kong Government (like drug trafficking and unlicensed medical practice, which aren't really crimes).\n\n&gt; Does it follow from that that all government is immoral?\n\nGetting back to my main argument; Government is immoral because it is funded through theft (taxes) which are immoral. If Government was voluntarily funded, then it would not be immoral.\n\n&gt; If you don't accept going to arbitration, you lose nothing.\n\nI disagree. I may lose the right to fight future claims, the ability to have a DRO accept me as a client, and shunning from the community. If I don't pay, the arbitrator could make a post on Facebook or another type of website for other people to see, including future employers. There are other types of punishment besides monetary.\n\n&gt; If you implemented that into your system, it would be just as immoral as government, by your standards at least.\n\nI disagree, since it was the original person that stole the $50. If he didn't steal it, it would be in his best social interest to prove his innocence. Or, he could just post his information on Facebook, and maybe find out that the other guy was saying that hundreds of people stole $50 from him. Then they could all get together, and shun the other guy for lying about it all. Either way, there are ways to make it work outside of a state-run criminal justice system.\n\n&gt; Now I ask, what makes coercion objectively and scientifically bad? You'll need to develop a moral system that crosses the is/ought gap. Otherwise, it boils down to something being bad because it feels bad. As skeptics, it is our self-imposed responsibility to attack positions based on feelings, rather than reason.\n\n&gt; Without evidence of it's inherent evilness, Ockham's razor disposes of such inherent qualities.\n\n&gt; If it is only subjectively bad, than you can not prove it to me and there is no reason for me to accept it, just like you can not prove that green is better than red. \n\nBut isn't this unprovable, since you can't scientifically prove that Government is good, just because it feels good. In your last statement you say "If it is only subjectively bad, then you can not prove it to me and there is no reason for me to accept it." So i could just retort with "You may think it's subjectively good, but you can't prove it to me and there is no reason for me to accept it. Plus, I have evidence of theft, [police brutality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=rwAQX0SWlhY), etc." Then we'd likely end up each listing things in our defense (i.e. I list all the bad things government does, you list all the good things government does). If there were thousands of bad things, and a few good things, then I could state the the Government is statistically more likely to do bad things. That makes it objective. You could still support Government if you wanted to, but I would have a lot of reasons and statistical evidence to think we'd be better off without its existence. I mean, this is why social science and economics are considered 'soft science' in the first place, and why this debate (government vs. non-government) is still ongoing. But just because you can't objectively settle something, doesn't mean that you can't change it. For example, you can't objectively state that Gay Marriage shouldn't be prohibited. Except you can, because the LGBT population wants the same rights as everyone else. There's no scientific evidence that says they should get married, but there's plenty of social evidence that says they should have the same rights because it's what they want. And in the same way, you should be able to have a government if you want one, and I should be able to move somewhere that is not under the jurisdiction of a Government. As of now, that's impossible.  \n\nLastly, as far as a moral stance goes, it would be the [Non-aggression Principle.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle)\n\nAnd to lighten the mood up, [here's a good picture.](http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/302794_10152309593045285_1602574834_n.jpg) [x-post from front page of /r/anarcho_capitalism.]	1354550638

This is a shame - I do believe that at one point Dr. Oz was a reputable source of medical information. When he first came on Oprah he was a consistent source of medical advice in a sea of quacks touting spiritual healing and homeopathy. My mom even credits him for helping her stop eating foods with added sugar, after seeing an episode where he talks about the correlation between consuming sugar and diabetes in overweight people. \n\nThat said, I'd have to imagine that when he was put in a position where he has to create content for hundreds of episodes per year and keep his ratings up, he 'sold out' and began allowing the quality of the medicine shared on his show to slip.	1302699671

That's why I hate the "don't be a dick" thing. It's so completely ridiculous, and it's even more insulting coming from intelligent people. Being a "dick" is completely relative. People can think you're a dick for all sorts of unfounded reasons. Am I to understand that I can't ever offend anyone's sensibilities, no matter how inane? \n\nI know it's supposed to be a "general rule" and all, and maybe I'm being a bit pedantic. But it's thrown about so flippantly, as if that one rule is the secret to everything. Just follow that, and you'll be okay. No, it's stupid. Sometimes, people need to be offended. Although, I wholeheartedly agree with the OP's point. Sometimes, you have to be less like a samurai and more like a ninja. But I'm not going to walk on eggshells for morons. 	1341541001

99% of the arsenic atoms are left in the existing solution; only 1% are used to make the new (diluted) solution. The dilution process isn't only "adding water", first you take a *part* of the previous solution to use, otherwise you'd end up with massive amounts of water... that's the whole point of using multiple steps. Didn't you ever dilute anything in Chemistry class?\n\n...or are you interpreting it as asking "what's the number of atoms including all the previous leftovers"? That's an invalid interpretation since it specifically asks what is the number in the current level of dilution.	1328288719

Pray to Jesus Christ, directly. Ask His help. If you've come to the point you're willing to sprinkle cooking products in a doorway, I'm sure the age old Jesus, Help Me has crossed your mind...BUT do it with belief, faith, intent, and love. Jesus was/is the physical representation of God's (universe/creator/xyz) Love for us. I can honestly tell you that whenever I have unwavering faith that Jesus will help me, He is there. And I'm not a church freak, and I don't talk much, if at all, about these things to people.\n\nIf youre having trouble with the faith part, first start asking for signs. Seriously, He will give u proof. Which only makes sense, He's not trying to trick us, the answers are there, just look.	1354933911

And "evidence-based" medicine is not infallible, it's a system of making the best educated guess you can. And evidence-based medicine is always changing and evolving as it should. Why? Because we learn more.

It is not a conspiracy when it is something not driven by a (presumably hidden) agreement among companies but instead by very clear (and legal) economics:\n\n- if the costs for a more advanced drug are very, very large and the chances to actually get it are actually very small a company will assign a very, very high risk to that research;\n\n- the research for a less spectacular drug (or a new use for an existing drug) can be easier and less expensive - and a company will assign a far more moderate risk to that;\n\n- on top of all things a company will assign an even smaller risk (or a higher benefit/risk ratio) for profits resulting from increased marketing;\n\n- when having to decide on funding some of many options, the profits/risk ratio will be the essential part (and I believe companies in some places are/were [required by law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Company) to act on maximizing returns for shareholders) - this explains why [all the large pharmaceutical companies in the world spend more for marketing than for actual research](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080105140107.htm) and spend more on 'safer' (but less spectacular) solutions rather than on more advanced solutions with a very unproven track.\n\nIt is a very bad thing (for the public) the fact that big pharma is spending huge amounts of money on lobbying for patent-law extensions - but since lobbying is perfectly legal that is not a conspiracy! It might be also bad for the public the fact that big pharma is investing a lot more money on extending patents for existing drugs by getting new uses for them - but again on that the problem was on creating the legal framework - so the public has to blame himself or his elected officials, or eventually start lobbying against such laws!\n	1321363310

&gt;Yes they can,\n\nFine.  You still haven't said anything negative about the 2500+ architects and engineers.  So there's that.\n\n&gt;The issue is elementary, \n\nAgreed.  \n\n&gt;The section addressing the idea that it was a controlled demolition is from 2006.\n\nThe [evidence of of explosives](http://stj911.org/press_releases/ActiveThermiticMaterial.html) (not that one really needs any further evidence than the video evidence of a near-free-fall collapse) is from 2009.  You are still citing an outdated opinion.\n\n&gt;Firstly, it gained speed\n\nYes, you are correct.  At first, it did gain speed - from 0 to near-free-fall.  And assuming the planes took-out the center columns (though unlikely an aluminum tube could pulverize concrete-reenforced center columns of the World Trade Towers, so as to create the opportunity for a near-free-fall event), the floors beneath (all 90+) offer nothing but resistance.\n\n&gt;momentum = mass * velocity\n\nYes, noting that "velocity" SHOULD decrease as the tops floors hit the resistance of the bottom floors, and "mass" will also be decreasing as debris from the structure (maybe 10%) will undoubtedly fall to the side.\n\nThe French are "famous" for developing a demolition technique that takes advantage of those physics:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFHEoiUZ7o\n\nThat said, the footage clearly demonstrates how the top floors are always self-destroying, **slowing and stoping**  eventually, due - needless to say - to the maintained structural integrity of the bottom floors:\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2td63_hd20h20070822chunk2_news\n\nUnder no circumstances will the top floors **gain** momentum after the "trigger" event:\n\n1.  standing bulding\n\n2.  trigger event:  top floors briefly "gain momentum" (from 0 - near free-fall -- takes about 2 seconds)\n\n3.  the top floors hit the bottom floors, and immediately begin to lose momentum = (the maintained structural integrity of the bottom floors = loss of velocity; and the debris flying off the edge = loss of mass).\n\n... that, unlike WTC1 and WTC2, where the buildings' collapsed maintained a **highly-unexpected** steady rate as the top 20 floors collapsed straight down and through the bottom 90 floors -- the path of greatest resistance.\n\n&gt;It's so damn straight forward, so simple and obvious\n\nI agree with you completely.  It's very straight forward.  (And we haven't even touched WTC7 -- nor did any planes, coincidentally.)\n\nFeel free to have the last word, as I am sure you will.  My intension wasn't to make you angry (as it appears I have), rather to simply inform you of some relevant and important details you have seemingly missed/side-stepped along the way.\n\nTake care.\n	1325430966

Feel free to post any studies which demonstrate, through scientific means, that acupuncture does anything that can't be achieved with a placebo. \n\n"Our nerves are weird." (Taken from another post of yours) isn't science.  It's demonstrative of a lack of knowledge, and you choose to fill in make-believe pseudoscience because of your lack of knowledge.  Our nervous system is very well understood.  Acupuncture is absolutely nonsense, and your post does nothing to demonstrate otherwise.  Just because a creationist thinks "people are complex", that doesn't mean that evolution is incorrect, and that there must have been a creator.  The same goes for acupuncture.\n	1307002124
I love MU too. But you are right that they are a bit less than skeptical. Aaron goes on and on about how he is a 'scientist by training', but without fail he somehow feels the need to come to a (usually) baseless conclusion for every topic they discuss. But he's honestly a great guy and so is Ben. They work very well together.\n\nI have to add: the music is beyond annoying. Arhythmic dubsteppy samples instead of songs, waay too much of it, and twice as loud as the talk segments so you need to repeatedly turn the volume up and down. It seems really incongruous to the subject matter. But it's worth enduring I guess. 	1329697132

There tends to be anomalies with the emf meter, these anomalies were assumed by some to be paranormal. I have not however seen convincing evidence of this.

"Why, exactly, is it objectionable for the government to infringe on these liberties, but not for a private employer?"\n\nI stopped reading after this sentence.

If you tell the government to kiss off you could end up with a bullet in the back of the head or thrown in a cell with little to no recourse.	1343090115
Thanks for that. I think there are also some ecological arguments against round-up ready crops.

In my experience Empaths &amp; Sensitives have many unexplained phenomena around them for most of their lives. Understanding friends' pain is unique &amp; wonderful, but there is a world of difference between  human empathy &amp; having a paranormal connection. I would advise you to never, never, NEVER invite in spirits, haunts, ghouls, ghosts, whatever you want to call it. It is a door that is really difficult to shut &amp; if you don't have proper guidance, it can ruin your life.\n\nMy advice? Just enjoy having an amazing connection with your friends. If things start to get weird &amp; the dead are speaking to you, then seek out help to understand what's going on. For now, please just develop your interpersonal relationships with the living... They make *far* better friends, I promise!	1340568654

Go back until they are no longer alive. Do you have ghost laws, laws that require a realtor to disclose any deaths that have occurred on property, in your area. If not all the ownership data has to be on file somewhere. Someone has what you are looking for, go to a mayors office and request records of the property. Then a local library should be able to have more detailed records through copies of old news papers.\n\nEven saying that you found cockroaches in the house and have to fumigate for a couple days could have people help you out while you continue with normal life and try to find more info.\n\nHonestly, My mate had a bad experience with a similar issue. Man killed himself in the house. Spirit did not realize it, continued to try and kill himself. The emotions and actions influenced my mate to fall into a horrible depression, and try to kill himself. After I got the house cleared, with help, while the family was in the hospital did he recover and went back to his normal happy self. It was over the course of six months, not to long.	1350509747

From the sidebar\n&gt; Need something debunked by those in the know? **Looking to exercise some critical thinking or research skills?** Want to eviscerate pseudoscience, idiocy, and irrationality wherever it lurks? Skeptic's Subreddit, where all the cool kids go.\n\n.\n\nFrom the [sidebar link](http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/manifesto.html)\n&gt; [L: skeptic defined as] One who doubts the validity of what claims to be knowledge in some particular department of inquiry; one who maintains a doubting attitude with reference to some particular question or statement. \n\n\n.\n\n&gt; The most ardent skeptics *enjoy their skepticism as long as it does not encroach upon their own cherished beliefs*. Then incredulity flies out the window. I once received a call from a gentleman who professed to be a skeptic, wanted to support the organization, and agreed with our skepticism about everything except the power of vitamins to restore health and attenuate disease. He hoped I would not be organizing any skeptical lectures or articles on this field, which, he explained, has now been proven scientifically to be effective. “Your field wouldn’t be vitamin therapy would it?,” I inquired. “You bet it is!” he responded.\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; *It is easy, even fun to challenge others’ beliefs, when we are smug in the certainty of our own*. **But when ours are challenged, it takes great patience and ego strength to listen with an unjaundiced ear**. But there is a deeper flaw in pure skepticism. Taken to an extreme the position by itself cannot stand. \n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; Nor does skepticism produce progress. It is not enough simply to reject the irrational. Skepticism must be followed with something rational, or something that does produce progress. As the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises warned against those anti-communists who presented no rational alternative to the system of which they were so skeptical (1956, p. 112):\n\n&gt; *"An anti-something movement displays a purely negative attitude. It has no chance whatever to succeed. It’s passionate diatribes virtually advertise the program they attack. People must fight for something that they want to achieve, not simply reject an evil, however bad it may be."*\n\n.\n\n**The Essential Tension Between Skepticism &amp; Credulity**\n\n&gt; It is important that we recognize the fallibility of science and the scientific method. But within this fallibility lies its greatest strength: self-correction. Whether mistakes are made honestly or dishonestly, whether a fraud is unknowingly or knowingly perpetrated, in time it will be flushed out of the system through the lack of external verification. [The cold fusion fiasco](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-10/29/rossi-success) is a classic example of the system’s swift consequences for error and hasty publication.\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; Because of the importance of this self-correcting feature, there is in the profession what Richard Feynman calls “a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty — a kind of leaning over backwards.” Feynman says:\n\n&gt; *"If you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid — not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results"* (1988, p. 247).\n\n.\n\n&gt; Despite these built in mechanisms science is still subject to a number of problems and fallacies that even the most careful scientist and rational skeptic are aware can be troublesome. We can, however, find inspiration in those who have overcome them to make monumental contributions to our understanding of the world. Charles Darwin is a sterling example of a scientist who struck the right balance in what Thomas Kuhn calls the **“essential tension” **in science between *total acceptance of and devotion to the status quo, and an open willingness to explore and accept new ideas* (1962, 1977). This delicate balance forms the basis of the whole concept of paradigm shifts in the history of science. When enough of the scientific community (particularly those in positions of power) are willing to abandon the old orthodoxy in favor of the (formerly) radical new theory, then, and only then can the paradigm shift occur.\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; This generalization about change in science is usually made about the paradigm as a system, but we must recognize that the paradigm is a only a mental model in the minds of individuals. Historian of science, Frank Sulloway, identifies three characteristics of Darwin’s intellect and personality that mark him as one of the handful of giants in the history of science who found the essential tension between skepticism and credulity (1991, p. 28): “First, although Darwin indeed had unusual reverence for the opinions of others, he was obviously quite capable of challenging authority and thinking for himself.” Second, “Darwin was also unusual as a scientist in his extreme respect for, and attention to, negative evidence.” Darwin included, for example, a chapter on ‘Difficulties on Theory’ in the Origin of Species; as a result his objectors were rarely able to present him with a challenge that he had not already confronted or addressed. Third, Darwin’s “ability to tap the collective resources of the scientific community and to enlist other scientists as fellow collaborators in his own research projects.” Darwin’s collected correspondence numbers greater than 16,000 extant letters, most of which involve lengthy discussions and question-and-answer sequences about scientific problems. *He was constantly questioning, always learning, confident enough to formulate original ideas, yet modest enough to recognize his own fallibility*.\n\n.\n\n\n\n&gt; A fourth characteristic that might be added is that Darwin maintained a good dollop of modesty and cautiousness that Sulloway sees as “a valuable attribute” that helps “prevent an overestimation of one’s own theories.” There is much to be learned in this regard from Darwin’s Autobiography. Darwin confesses that he has “no great quickness of apprehension or wit which is so remarkable in some clever men,” a lack of which makes him “a poor critic: a paper or book, when first read, generally excites my admiration, and it is only after considerable reflection that I perceive the weak points.” Unfortunately many of Darwin’s critics have selectively quoted such passages against him, not seeing the advantage Darwin saw in the patient avoidance of regrettable mistakes made in haste (1892, p. 55):\n\n&gt; "I think that I have become a little more skillful in guessing right explanations and in devising experimental tests; but this may probably be the result of mere practice, and of a larger store of knowledge. I have as much difficulty as ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty has caused me a very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating advantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus I have been often led to see errors in reasoning and in my own observations or those of others."\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; His is a lesson in science well worth learning. What Sulloway sees as particularly special about Darwin was his ability to resolve the essential tension within himself. “Usually, it is the scientific community as a whole that displays this essential tension between tradition and change,” Sulloway observes,\n\n&gt; *"since most people have a preference for one or the other way of thinking. What is relatively rare in the history of science is to find these contradictory qualities combined in such a successful manner in one individual"* (p. 32).\n\n.\n\n\n\n&gt; Carl Sagan summed up this essential tension (in Basil, 1988, p. 366):\n\n&gt; *"It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas. If you are only skeptical, then no new ideas make it through to you. You never learn anything new. You become a crotchety old person convinced that nonsense is ruling the world. (There is, of course, much data to support you.) On the other hand, if you are open to the point of gullibility and have not an ounce of skeptical sense in you, then you cannot distinguish the useful ideas from the worthless ones. If all ideas have equal validity then you are lost, because then, it seems to me, no ideas have any validity at all."*\n\n.\n\n\n\n&gt; There is some hope that rational skepticism, and the vigorous application of the scientific method, can help us find this balance between pure skepticism and unmitigated credulity. \n\n&gt; Carl Sagan sounded a similar warning to skeptics:\n\n&gt; ***"You can get into a habit of thought in which you enjoy making fun of all those other people who don’t see things as clearly as you do. We have to guard carefully against it"*** (in Basil, 1988, p. 366).\n\n	1320255380
&gt;Seems like if you use the tape like athletes do on TV (put it on during your performance, and then take it off), it works.\n\nHold on, we don't have enough evidence to make a claim as strong as that. Currently we can only say that using the tape is better than not using the tape. To say that "it works", we need to demonstrate that it works at a rate greater than placebo, which no study has been able to show.	1344066830

I use EFT sometimes on 2-3 clients a week. I have been doing it for about 6 years. \nYes, it works. \nThe trouble is sometimes it works too well and when I talk about it, it sounds fantastical. \n\nMy favorite quick EFT sessions are phobias. \n\nA common example of this is someone comes in with an extreme phobia of birds. We talk about it and I find out she links this to one huge traumatic event when she was younger involving the family chicken. As we talk about it I tap on the EFT points and have her stop every once and a while and rate the level of her anxiety she feels in her body when she thinks of that memory or birds in general. Soon the memory no longer holds the 'emotional' power it had. It no longer triggers her hyperarousal when she thinks about birds. \n\nI saw her later that week with her husband and she ran up to me and gave me a hug. Her husband was all smiles telling me how amazing it is that she is not afraid of birds. How she would make him go outside and scare birds out of the yard so she could get to her car. \n\nThose are the ones that tend to go really quickly. \n\nI think about EFT quite a bit when I watch that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind movie. Not erasing *actual* memories but simply removing any fight or flight triggers that still exist in traumatic memories.\n\nI am also a LMT and when I have clients that have limited ROM in their necks I always ask about and trauma. If they quickly recall the memory of a specific neck trauma I do EFT on the memory. I love the feeling of the muscles relaxing and their astonishment at being able to turn their heads. \n\nRepeated traumatic histories like abuse and war related PTSD can take much longer that one session but most everyone will feel a change in the specific triggers we work on. \n\nI know this thread is about the science of EFT and I see lots of neuroscience articles that fit my view of how EFT might work but in the end it is a technique. It is a pattern anyone can learn in 5 min, apply and make a personal experiment with. I would greatly encourage you to try. it. 	1343287110
Happens. At Universal, some old guy died of old on the stairs in front of where you get onto the seats for the Mummy ride. There were so many problems with sightings and people being spooked they roped off those stairs, made a new walkway, and put up red lights (the most interesting note). The walkway was just an alternative route to the exit leading to the mummystore, as you could mostly see when walking around the side exits. So next time you see red lighting for no particular reason in a theme park, or potentially maybe anywhere, keep a mind out. 	1342989862

&gt;Consider it in reference to evolution/creationism, or climate science/denialism.\n \nIf you look at it that way, then that makes sense, but the cartoon was initially pretty vague in what it was going after. I thought it was going after the whole argument if there was a god or not. You though it to be in reference to evolution/creationism etc. I would have to agree with you if it was the latter. \n \n&gt;Which doesn't meant different positions are on equal footing.\n \nNo it doesn't. The onus is usually on someone. But as far as proving if some entity exists that can be called a "god" or "higher purpose" the onus is on both parties even though it's most likely that he does not exist.	1274198357

&gt;I think that you have a massive blind spot to this situation. You are getting accused of being poor at impartial judgement yet again, you are getting downvoted yet again. It might be that you simply aren't as impartial as you think.\n\nIt seems unlikely that everyone who mentions feminism on reddit is biased and carries a massive blind spot. But look at some of my comments getting downvoted: \n\n- one was a question as to whether someone's description of a position was accurate and whether it wasn't possible that they were confusing criticism of the patriarchy with criticism of men. For that I have currently received **25 downvotes**. \n\n- one comment was me stating that I was editing my last post because I had incorrectly quoted someone. For that I have currently received **5 downvotes**.\n\n- I then point out that institutional sexism still exists. For that I have currently received **6 downvotes**. \n\nI think when I start getting downvoted for correcting my unintentional misquotation of someone, then the problem most likely isn't with me. \n\nI don't think I'm a particularly offensive poster, and I don't think (before recently) I've ever had a karma score for a comment below zero. But, without changing my posting style and (as far as I know) without attacking anyone, I've suddenly started receiving mass downvotes. The only difference is that I've mentioned feminism in a non-negative light. \n\nTry it one day. Create a sockpuppet account, jump into one of these threads and say something entirely unoffensive and uncontroversial like "I think feminism makes some valid points", and you'll likely be downvoted. \n\n&gt;I will admit that I struggle with being impartial in this case (although I feel that recognizing my bias does help a bit to overcome it) in the opposite direction (I started out sympathetic, but was quickly turned off and probably to a degree where I'm too emotionally vested).\n\nThat's fair enough, and it's great that you're attempting to be aware of your biases. With me though, I don't really care who is right or wrong on this issue. I find some feminist arguments convincing because they are backed by solid argumentation and empirical evidence, so when people make contradictory statements I point out where I think they're going wrong and I ask them to explain why they think I'm wrong. \n\nIf feminism is wrong, or if atheism+ is a completely stupid idea, it makes absolutely no difference to me. I will inevitably have the biases which are common to all people at all times, but my point was just that I don't see how I can be biased one way or the other on this issue as I have no allegiances or commitments to either conclusion.\n\n&gt;In our previous discussions I noticed that you don't really listen to opposing arguments,\n\nI can't understand why you'd say that. I took a lot of time reading through your comments and I provided detailed responses. I don't think it's accurate to say that I wasn't really "listening to opposing arguments" simply because I took the time to explain why I think they're incorrect. It is, of course, possible to 'listen' to someone and not agree with them. \n\n&gt;and you have a tendency to be highly aggressive.\n\nI think perhaps you're confusing me with someone else there... I read through our previous discussion to make sure I didn't step out of line at some point, but I didn't remember getting angry or aggressive at any point and I couldn't find any comments which suggested such. \n\n&gt;That is probably counter to your claim of impartiality.\n\nI disagree. Impartiality doesn't mean that all views are given equal weight. I understood *exactly* where you were coming from with your criticisms of concepts like patriarchy and privilege and I tried to explain to you why you were fundamentally misunderstanding those concepts. But if you had fully grasped those concepts, and then highlighted a possible flaw in those things, then I would absolutely support you. \n\nI just can't help comparing the situation to a creationist discussing evolution with a biologist, and the creationist complaining that the biologist is biased because he wasn't really listening to opposing arguments like, "If man evolved from monkeys then why are there still monkeys?". I know it's an insulting comparison and I don't mean to imply that you personally are as bad as a creationist (you're obviously far smarter than those people) but the similarity is the failure to grasp the core concepts required to make valid criticisms of the field. 	1348023518

Okay I'll bite. When I was fresh to ritually cleansing houses I had this dark and moody female friend come to me and state that she had entered a blood pact with the devil. Knowing that this could mean anything, I listen to the fully extent of her story of paranormal phenomenon and traumatic abuse she experienced as a child; and how these paranormal experiences were seeming to become aggressive to her being a by stander to the judo/christian mysticism I used in the course of my hobby. I believe she said the entities actually semi-manifest and told her so. So she decided both that she didn't want any part of that anymore, and to ask for my help.\nAs it happen I did manage to have a ritual for breaking a blood pact, so I thought I'd give it a go as the worse case would just be psycho drama and a bad emotional experience.\nIt was going fine with some elements showing of minor spiritual obsession/possession which I had no problem handling with a minor improvised exorcism to accompany the task at hand. However, I did notice a strong but quiet change in the ambiance. I also thought I noticed what I call lyaks in the outskirts of my field of vision, but I pushed ahead. This was soon followed by a scream from a different side of the yard. I rush over to find out that my then girlfriend, and my sister had both seen one of those very shadow entities run across a well lit area. Mind you they had no idea about the aspects of what I was doing; So for sake of confirmation I asked them to describe exactly what they had seen. A with out hesitation and no knowledge of such things described a three foot tale dark humanoid that ran right by them nearly in unison. I've seen and dealt with these before but these two had no experience in either my beliefs or my practices or anything paranormal in general.\nThen another friend spotted one on the other side of the yard again (half acre property). Ultimately about fiver of those were seen that night. The thing that got to me though was the appearance of two other things. The first which was spotted by myself and the formally afflicted person was a dark entity approximately seven feet tale with visible glowing red eyes. The second and I believe if I remember correctly I might have been the only one to witness this was a glowing white sphere with possible blue outline about a foot in diameter that was clashing with that seven foot dark entity and seemingly to repel it. Considering all this and the barking dogs ( I know, it sounds like a bad rip off of the movie The Exorcist, maybe fear made me notice) I rounded up everyone inside and started casting wards and prayers until sunrise.\nWith that my friend went on for a time to be very religious which ultimately didn't last long but never had another of those paranormal experiences as far as I'm aware.\nAlso as for my use of the term lyaks, this terminology isn't credible as I actually got that name from a horror story and it seemed to fit. For the closest/best match to the entities I am describing in a demonology sense you'd have to go back to Pre-Christian Judaic mythology regarding demons a little entities that run around and harass the living back when Sammel filled the role of the devil (or close enough too it).\n\nQuestion is, what's your take on the Big one? First time I'd seen anything like that. 	1323742611
One thing I find fascinating about the God of the Gaps argument is that it is always formulated in terms of something we know we don't know.  Thus, as that page points out, you go from lightning to planetary physics to diseases to universe causality.  But it seems like you only had planetary physics being brought up *after* lightning became common knowledge, disease only *after* planetary physics, etc.  That is, the GotG argument always tails science by complaining about the current border of knowledge.\n\nThat might seem like a trivial truism (how could you formulate an argument about something you don't know you don't know?), but the end result is that the theist making the argument is *necessarily* on the heels of scientists who are attempting to explain nature precisely without any supernatural phenomena.  It's an admission of a fundamental misunderstanding of science.  Of *course* science is at the edge of human knowledge - where else could it be?  It also admits a misunderstanding of knowledge itself as a thing which is in constant flux as opposed to the theist's apparent interpretation of it as a stationary concept.\n\nAnyway, I'm not trying to make any kind of argument here, I just find these things interesting.	1288374377
Eh, pre-long-form-release, I might have agreed with you.

If they don't get it now, they never will, because they're either neurologically or willfully stupid. \n	1337362649

The media is controlled by four major corporations, all of which are run by very wealthy, elite individuals who 'play the global game'. Anyone running a network will never have gotten there in the first place unless they play by the rules. They are very heavily pressured to not run anything that is too in favor of 'the truth'.\n\nAnd from a journalistic perspective, no one believes anything unless a senior politician says it's the truth... and even then (because this has happened often even within the US military)... people look the other way. The President could come out and say it, but unless he has evidence to show the world, no one would believe him.\n\nAnd all the evidence is controlled by the people who run the global system; the energy industries, military-industrial complex, and banking sectors.

It's become very clear that the term "circlejerk" on reddit now just means "A very large amount of people who don't agree with what I personally believe."\n\nAlso, it really helps to identify the pettiest of people. Much like if you meet someone who's car is covered in bumper stickers, you don't want to be their friend, if someone yells "circlejerk," they obviously have nothing worthwhile to say.\n\nI still can't believe you came to /r/skeptic, and then got *so very angry* that people were skeptical of these anecdotal, non-verifiable claims.

Me thinks you misunderstand what I meant by the third-- if I'm wrong, I can't, by definition, prove myself right. What I mean when I say I take it as a personal standard is that if I hold an opinion or make an assertion, I'm going to damn well make sure it can ALWAYS be proven right.	1280598845

See this has always been the true question for me, what do the aliens get out of this deal for helping humans? The only logical reasoning I could come up with is that these aliens think completely different than humans. Humans are selfish and emotional creatures, it could be possible that these aliens are simply paying it forward and desire nothing. You can almost compare it to the US or UN helping other countries but on a much grander scale, and yet there is absolutely nothing in any form or capacity we could offer them in exchange for their knowledge.	1334696772

Really, the start of what you said is stuff that I have said many times. However, the answer to that is almost never to say "Check your privilege" - someone who says something that off is probably going to become very, very hostile at that phrase (and not completely without reason). The solution might be to explain (very briefly) that this person hasn't experienced the kind of racial injustice that the word nigger comes from, and that their experience doesn't allow them to fully understand how it feels to someone else. I know, it's the old 101 argument, but to me it's fairly valid, especially if you have a 101 level doc you can link to instead of explaining. It might come across as tone, but we are humans, and tone really does matter. Now, I'm not saying that women need to speak in respectful tone to men all the time, but I am saying that screaming at someone who just doesn't get it makes them get it less, dismissing someone who just doesn't get it makes them get it less. Both of these make them *want* to get it less.\n\nThe Rush example is actually a pretty good one, but if you use it on the people who love Rush, they won't get it either.\n\nFinally, my point throughout any discussion of privilege, is that people don't just have or not have privilege. There are elements of privilege in any group in certain circumstances. There are circumstances where a poor inner city black female has power that a straight white cis male doesn't have, and where she has privilege that he doesn't. Damn few of them admittedly, but they do exist. To use check your privilege as I have seen it used a fair bit recently is sometimes a case of not actually recognizing your own privilege (for example: I was homeless, 16, white, and male - there are a shitload of programs for homeless people, but any one that is for a specific group isn't for straight white middle aged males, the only special category I fit into that would open up more programs was the youth category, it would have been even worse had I been a bit older in terms of programs - black would have opened up a bunch, female even more, handicapped even more, the only one that seems to really fuck you over is some form of mental illness, which pretty much makes the rest of it null and void). The person I was arguing with could not understand that for that very, very narrow set of circumstances being white made things harder, being male made things harder. Once I got out of the absolute bottom position in society, those qualities made things easier (I can actually tell, I've lived in circumstances other than homelessness where those things are not advantages to the same degree including one country where being white means you can't go outside after dark and during the day you have to be damned careful, because you are at a high risk of getting shot at all times).	1347479747
&gt;Its an explanation of how people are inclined to misinterpret things as being paranormal given certain conditions.\n\nI just read the article and can confirm. The article tries to explain away people's perceived eyewitness of the paranormal by theorizing that their extravagant accounts are nothing more that creative inventions of a person psychologically predisposed to believe such phenomena (which have been synthesized from an otherwise normal and mundane situation).\n\nI can credit the attempt to explain a person's perception of paranormal encounters, but I couldn't help but notice a skeptic's bias in the research. They quoted the X-Files (*rolls eyes*), they jokingly mention "little green men from the planet Glank" among other references to paint the picture that all paranormal experiences are nothing but "hooey," and they end with saying that any and all research into the paranormal is nothing more than fruitless distractions from solid scientific branches of study like zoology and astronomy--which seems like a very unfair thing to say.	1351222455

I believe the lights are a camouflage. Most of the pics or videos of any ufos that I have seen has lights on them and it was very difficult to make out any specific structure which has intense lights on them. It's like camouflage in public view. You're looking at the object but can't make out any features or characteristics of the object itself other than the speed it was traveling or a generic outline of the object itself. Every photo that has been taken of an ufo which has lights on it seems to be very blurry so as to not give any detail of the object itself. \n\nRecently, I heard about a pilot who chased an ufo in a jet and reached very close to it but even he couldn't make out any details of the object and only said that the object was illuminated by a very bright intense light.	1308372443

My father-in-law, I think in 1967, was driving across the US to California with a friend. They stopped by the side of the highway in Oklahoma and saw a very large, metallic disc-shaped craft hovering at low altitude. As they watched, it rotated onto its side and they noticed a symbol that resembled a swastika and a trident on the bottom. It then flew off suddenly at very high speed and was gone within seconds. A minute later a jet fighter flew overhead, apparently trying to follow it.\n\nMy wife, as a teenager around 1990, was driving to the supermarket with her sister from their home in Novato, CA late one evening. As they drove westward on a straight road they noticed a bright light that appeared to be on the nearby hills/mountains. At first they thought it was headlights of a car in the hills, but as they drove toward it it rose into the sky (possibly because they were getting closer to it). They drove around a 90 degree turn in the road, and the light in the sky moved at high speed until it was almost directly in front of them again. It was now closer and they could see two bright white lights on it. As they drove toward it it moved away and to the right, in the general direction of their destination. They were able to watch it in the sky most of the way there, and when they parked in the parking lot and get out of their car, it flew slowly over them at fairly low altitude and they could see that it had four lights arranged in a square shape, and was completely silent. As they watched it accelerated again and flew towards the bay.	1268249777

What makes you think that those could *not be* Chinese Lanterns?  Do they display anomalistic fight characteristics or appear to be under intelligent control in any way?  Have you ever seen hundreds of Chinese Lanterns aloft in the sky?  I have, and I can assure you that they look and behave *exactly* like those seen in the videos you posted.\n\nBottom line (and a UFOlogy lesson for you):\nIf they can be easily explained (or have been attributed to a known event, such as a release of party balloons, etc.) as Chines Lanterns, they are *more likely than not* what they appear to be.  Occam's Razor, critical thinking, basic reasoning all trump your desire to believe or see UFOs in these things.\n\nNow, if they couldn't be explained as lanterns, or a balloon hoax (a la Bill Birnes' UFO Hunters failed to identify) and displayed truly anomalous behavior, I'd tend to agree with you.  As such, all you would get - were you to report the sighting to MUFON or CUFOS - is a "thank you very much for your report, however we seem to have reasonable evidence to support the notion that these are likely Chinese Lanterns or some such human-originated device."\n\nDo you want to believe that badly that everything you see in the skies is a UFO and can't be explained away prosaically?  If so, you are pursuing the wrong subject and won't get very far with your brand of UFOlogy.  No offense, but I'm beginning to tire from constantly laying out the basic fundamentals of skeptical inquiry to everyone who posts a video of *likely* (again, I said "likely") Chinese Lanterns.	1302032347
Well... where this image came from is obviously illuzone (whatever the hell that is).  But the flouride is bad for you thing comes from years of conspiracy mongering starting decades ago (1940's - 50's), and really picked up in the 60's with the John Birch Society (a far right wing group) pushing against water fluoridation.\n\nOnly one item on that list has any evidence to support it and that is [dental fluourosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis) (at least in any dose that you would be consuming).  Since Dental flourosis is largely cosmetic, it is far outweighed by the benefits of public fluoridation.\n\nMore [/r/skeptic](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/search?q=fluoride&amp;restrict_sr=on) threads about it.\n\nMore [/r/askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=fluoride&amp;restrict_sr=on) threads about it.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that many water fluoridation plants REMOVE excess fluoride from public water sources because natural levels are high.	1342119787

Well I've asked my older sister if she senses these things, and she says she has, but not as much as me. My younger sister hasn't sensed any of these things, so far it's just been my friend and I that have been affected by her presence.

So I'm planning to do some paranormal investigations during October to test my limits, or if its just my imagination.

I think that this is somewhat unfair. There's a clear difference in economic policies under Republicans versus Democrats. \n\nDemocrats are somewhat Keynesian, while Republicans are heavily supply-side. Keynesian economic practices are more likely to produce jobs, because they oftentimes call for government's direct intervention into the market. (See, for example, Obama's jobs plan).\n\nIn other words, there's a clear correlation between Keynesian policies and job growth (which usually translates to a higher GDP, which in turn buoys the stock market, etc, etc). \n\nNow, I can already hear what you're thinking: correlation doesn't equal causation. Well, to this I say sure, but correlation over a long period of time (and it's been decades by this point), lends a high degree of confidence to the idea that they are correlated because of a causal relationship. However, as is ever the bane of economics, there is no way to empirically test the relationship in a systematic fashion.\n\nBut yeah, this isn't useless information. I think it requires a background in economics to really understand, but it proves the democrat (or, I would more fairly say) Keynesian side quite well.\n\nAnd the President really does have a lot to do with the macro side of economic performance and job creation. Sure, he doesn't have much of anything to do with individual commodities like oil (barring, of course, such heavy-handed policies such as bailouts or subsidies), but the president does greatly influence the overall economy.	1351952008

&gt;Doctors are taught during medical school and residency that pharmaceutical drugs are the only effective medicine.   \n\nYou're either frighteningly misinformed or outright lying.  This is just one of those statements where I don't know where to begin.  It's not even wrong.   \n&gt; Most doctors do not continue learning after residency.   \n   \nYou obviously have no idea how medical education in this country works.  Physicians constantly have to learn and update their knowledge of current best practices to maintain their license through CME.  In addition, board certified physicians (which is pretty much everyone these days as more and more insurance companies use lack of board certification to deny payment) must renew their certification via testing and other procedures on a regular basis.   \n\n&gt; Even if non-pharmaceutical drugs (such as vitamin D) exist for the disease, doctors won't use them.*   \n   \nThe information you provide to go with this asterisk disprove what you're saying.  Increasing intake of vitamin D does appear to be promising for many diseases and conditions.  However, the science is not yet there for it be considered best practice in most cases.  However, just because something is promising or because it makes sense does not mean doctors should begin changing their practice.  It was just in the last year or two where we discovered that calcium supplementation with or without vitamin D actually increased risk of heart disease and stroke.  Just last month a major study came out that showed an increased risk of death in patients who took iron and other daily supplements.  We know that a potential cause of cancer is DNA damage to reactive oxygen species.  Therefore it made perfect sense that supplementation with antioxidants like vitamin E would be protective.  The hypothesis proved true in animal models.  But it doesn't work in humans and we don't why.  That's why the studies are done.  That's why studies are being done on vitamin D right now.  If physicians were to start changing practice before the science came in, they would kill more people than they would help.	1319501418
If there was a mistake made in quoting some figure about cancer survival rates, I'm sure everybody would be amenable to a correction.\n\nAnd as for organic food, I believe the discussion was about how overrated and overpriced it was.  Certainly there's room for discussion about how some farming methods may be better than others, and a discussion of that nature would be fascinating.  \n\nBut it sounds to me like you agree that the label "organic" as it's currently used is pretty useless and over-hyped.  I think that's pretty much all that the discussion was about.\n\nIt seems strange to be annoyed just because nobody bothered to look at the benefits of different farming methods.  The discussion had to do with how some foods were sold on the basis of wildly overstated health claims.  Why would farming methods even come up?	1318273477

Yeah, I can understand your experience. What changed things for me is an insane experience when I was 14. I had been studying the paranormal for 4-5 years already by then. I have seen colors in my vision since I was about 8. They fluctuate and change constantly when I am in a relaxed state. Sorry if I ramble, as I am drunk. Anyways, I thought I was seeing auras, or some energy field in my vision. I had tried astral projection for a few years with no luck.\n\nSometime when I was 14 I took a big dose of LSD. I had the worst experience of my life, and I felt like I was going to die for 12 hours. I know this probably discredits anything I say from here-on-out. I don't care. I heard tribal drumming, and saw DNA helices being constructed and re-constructed in front of my eyes. I experienced the universe from the view of itself looking in upon itself, and what psychonauts call "ego death" in its entirety. Once again, this is a looooong story.\n\nI woke up the next day feeling like I was just born again. Everything I experienced felt novel and sharp. I realized that everything I have gone through as a child was a kind of conditioning to minimize sensory input into what is "natural" to survive in our complex world. All day we are bombarded with sensory input. Out brain filters out 99% of the world, and works on past memories to function socially. \n\nWhen you look at a clock sometimes it seems that the second hand stays there for longer than a second. This is called the [chronostasis illusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronostasis). It actually seems like a second lasts longer than it does.\n\nThis brings me to my main point, and my point of understanding from my hellish ordeal. The world we experience is largely created by our brain. Not only that, but the plasticity of our brains as children hones in on these illusions, and imagination to create memories. What you remember isn't what happened, and only your worldly way of dealing with the influx of sensory input that overwhelms your brain at the time.\n\nPreconceptions about what you are going to experience play into this. There is somewhat of an experience-placebo effect to memory if you have an idea in mind. I honestly don't trust my memory. I have seen impossible things happen in the past.\n\nWe then get to a philosophical question. Is our perception of the world ACTUALLY what is going on? Most likely not.\n\n**This is a big reason that science is so important when judging said phenomenon.**\n\nWe need to test and retest experiences with many individuals, and in different environments to see what is the consensus *reality*. We need verifiable proof to say what is real. We need hard science.	1323247157

We really should start setting a precedent on this subreddit of linking to sources. I believe [this](http://heart.bmj.com/content/98/12/920.abstract) is the study being referred to here. The study still found lower rates of heart attack in people who took calcium supplements compared to people that had low calcium levels. It was only when comparing people who had normal levels of calcium that got all of their calcium from their diet to people that got all calcium from supplements that the supplement users had increased heart attack, and this is likely due to them just not absorbing as much calcium as the dietary users.\n\nCalcium in a pill doesn't absorb as readily as dietary calcium, and to absorb calcium you need things like vitamin D. I would recommend looking for food without lactose.	1348797382

[Cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)  exist and influence our judgments and the whole point of science (which is rather a bunch of methods than a world-view) is to  overcome our own weaknesses in this respect.\nAsk them, why traditional/alternative medicine didn't find out about how flawed our judgments are.\nE.g. "like-goes-with-like" is a reasoning heuristic that humans apply and makes homeopathy sound plausible.\n\nPoint to optical illusions. They always work, even if you know that what you see can't be right. If even our immediate perception of the world is broken, why should our memory and reasoning (which builds on our perceptions) be perfect and completely different from our senses?	1304670266

This has been happening to me personally my entire life (starting when I was 13, I'm 27 now).\n\nThis looks pretty serious. I know you might not be a spiritual person, I'm not either really. She needs to ward off these spirits now before it gets worse. Alone. \n\nThis spirit or energy, I prefer to call it the later, has the power to follow her. This has nothing to do with your house or location. Something is obviously attacking her personally. I've been followed by this energy as well in multiple locations. And it seems to attack me when I'm at my worse (stress, high anxiety, etc). \n\nShe needs to believe that she has control. Say a strong prayer (believe in strongly, don't half ass) or something of the equivalency. This has nothing to do with modern religion and waving a bible around will only work if you believe in it. I personally drew up some ancient symbols and said a strong prayer to myself. So far, I haven't been touched in a year now. \n\nI know this sounds crazy but the morale of the story is she needs to confront her demons and ward them off. Her scars look really, really bad. More severe than I've ever had. Try not to think about it and for sure don't act scared. Anything that will give this energy more fuel for the fire will not help your situation. \n\nAnother strategy would be to ignore it entirely. Maybe this energy is seeking attention. However, ignoring it might spark more activity. I'm not sure. \n\nI wish I knew who and what this energy is and giving advice is hard because not every attack is the same. I'm still trying to figure our why its happening to me. All I know is that training your spirit and mind to take control of the situation helped me.\n\nFeel free to message me anytime. 	1351088776

Again, I'll remind you of some key facts:\n\n1) the appeal to popularity is fallacious.

So far all you've done is to continue to demonstrate why you are completely unable to comment meaningfully on this discussion (i.e. you don't understand the fundamental issues relating to the topic, subreddit, or philosophy of skepticism).	1354004017

Like most interactions it's a judgement about what those involved stand to gain versus what they stand to lose and the likely outcome. I see little value in jumping on every woo-ish statement I hear in casual conversation. If someone is offering poor advice in a group setting then I'd feel free to offer a counter-position to the person being advised but providing an unrequested debunking of a simple statement of personal belief? Not so much.\n\nOn the other hand, your question asks about non-skeptic *friends*. You might be using the term in a more inclusive manner than I would but I'd expect a friendship to include some sort of mutual understanding. Either that understanding is that you can speak freely or there's a line that you don't cross to avoid getting in each other's face. Personally, I wouldn't put up with a line that allowed the other person to say what they liked and insisted that I didn't express disagreement.\n\nThere's no easy answer. Realistically there will always be people who will get pissed off if you confront them and who you don't want to piss off: your parents, your boss, your landlord, the bartender at your favourite drinking hole. Right now I'm temporarily sharing a house with an alternative therapist who is into all sorts of stuff that I could express a view on. If she asks me what I think I'll tell her but I'm not about to invite a discussion that I know has a chance of causing problems outside of a disagreement about whether she can treat people by moving their skull bones around.\n	1327216181

Yes, but it is still an incredibly small number of sightings. The poor quality of current recording devices doesn't help either.

There are a lot of scenarios. Infinite, if we include all the possible ones we could conjure up in our own minds. \n\nAbduction cases are interesting and 3rd kind encounters where a person shows physical evidence of having been in contact with something such as the guy in the woods who heard a noise in the woods while he was out fishing or hunting or some such activity and came across a craft.\n\nHe heard voices, which sounded like human vocalization, but not a language he was familiar with.\n\nHe approached the craft and suffered burns on his chest from what he described as an exhaust portal that opened up, blasted him, threw him down and the craft left. Pretty fascinating tale. Not to mention Betty and Barny Hill, equally interesting and quite a few others involving airmen, police and what one would consider completely legitimate and valid sources of tales of such magnitude.\n\nWhat can be deduced is:\n1.Something is happening\n2.It is rare relative to the actual true amount of abductions and sightings\n3.Governments may very well be involved\n4.It may all stem from the secret space program developed by USSR and the USA following Operation Paperclip in 1944-45.\n\nOn point 4 it can't be stated enough just how amazingly parallel the two programs were and how the partnership has been developed to this point now where it's at. All launches to the ISS are private and manned launches are funded but launched on Russian rockets in Russian capsules. \n\nFor instance Skunkworks  mothballed the SR-71 years ago. What was newly developed and not exposed to the public that would lead to getting rid of the fastest, highest flying manned aircraft ever made? \n\nWhat about electro magnetic propulsion? It's known about. Why would it not be employed when it is one of the known 4 forces of physics? Or even used in a manner of assisting flight?\n\nAlso, mercury/cesium ion propulsion is of some interest.\n\nThese are all of great interest I think. It would be nice to be able to not be impeded by hoarders of hoaxery while learning of the topics.	1343692482

I don't know what skeptics you're talking about but I can't think of any I know how are closed-minded as you describe. In fact it is open-mindedness and a desire for the truth that makes one become very skeptical in the first place. That's partly why people with absolutely no evidence on their side (simply a personal preference or anecdotal information), claiming open-mindedness as a defense is often so infuriating to a skeptic. If they were truly open-minded they would more highly respect evidence, even if that evidence greatly disagreed with their deepest beleifs or forced them to admit they had been wrong. That kind of open-mindedness is rare though. Most people aren't willing to face the possibility that at points they have been deeply wrong or had acted a fool. There's no shame in that though, only in not trying to be warier next time.\n\nScience requires open mindedness. It's a process not a solution, therefore relying on science means often getting answers you wouldn't expect, didn't want and even sometimes can't yet explain. Yet, despite this you still respect and embrace the process in the sense that it was an attempt to seek truth. Also, real science done correctly need not worry who is funding, just who is editing the publishing the results. Someone genuinely skeptical is certainly also skeptical as to whether the science was conducted properly and can be reproduced independently.  	1241122669

Positive attitude helps a patient deal with the course of the illness, but it has no effect on treatment success rates.\n\nJust two things to read about it:\n\n[Positive Attitude Doesn't Whip Cancer?](http://www.webmd.com/cancer/news/20071022/positive-attitude-doesnt-whip-cancer) from WebMD, which is just a barebones overview, incidentally featuring a doctor from MSK.\n\n[Emotional well-being does not predict survival in head and neck cancer patients](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.23080/full) from the journal *Cancer*.\n\nOne study does not a rule make, I understand, but there's a body of literature that's been growing over the last few years about positive attitude and cancer treatment effectiveness. You can probably Google around and find more without too much effort.\n\nOtherwise, I agree with your comment wholeheartedly.	1297626628
&gt; the overuse of sports drink and sodas\n\nThe author doesn't say anything about "overusing" sports drinks or sodas. Absolutely everything from milk to oxygen to Vitamin B can be dangerous or detrimental if overused/over-ingested.\n\nWhat this loon has to say is that sports drinks/sodas in any dose are dangerous. Which is, of course, something only a loon would say. 	1326703834

These things have little to do with each other.  Evolution is a theory that is well-established and backed up by a great deal of evidence; the chemical origins of life is very speculative at this point in time; global warming is not as well-established as evolution but nearly as well backed up by evidence; and human cloning is more a technology than a science for which any objections would be moral or legal, not scientific.\n\nThese disparate things are a pretty blatant laundry list of issues that concern modern-day religions, and if this bill really does tie all these things together, then I'd think it would not be too hard to argue that it constitutes a state ruling driven by church demands, and it sets a very bad precedent if it's allowed to stand.	1334146408

Idealistically, I'm more or less anarcho-communist, but I also recognize that the only way that such a system is possible is to have &gt;99% of people on this planet die, and that's not even remotely an acceptable tradeoff to me, so in practice, I tend to be a more standard European-style social democrat.

&gt; If its a chain pharmacy the pharmacist has no say in what goes on the shelf.\n\nThat is of course true, and I'm trying not to blame the salespeople. However, "I'm just doing my job" is a very, *very* poor excuse for doing something unethical. And make no mistake - it is: You are selling people in a weak or desperate position something that will certifiably do *nothing* to help them, and that at a higher price that something else that actually would.\n\nThey may not want to do it, but they still *do.*\n\n&gt; And then you have people who swear by homeopathic remedies such as this.\n\nYou see, I have this naive, idealistic view that a pharmacy is a place where you get stuff that works against disease and for your well-being.\n\nI have an even more heretic view, namely that "patient choice" is a joke. A patient doesn't want to choose, a patient wants to get better. Selling him something of which he has been mislead to think it'll help but which factually actually doesn't breaches the trust that I set in health care professionals such as pharmacists.\n\n&gt; Plus it cost the store more for that item as well, they aren't going to charge you less than they paid for it just because the competing item is cheaper.\n\nWell, reducing a pharmacy to a purely profit-driven market entity is a rather bleak vision. I thought we were talking about health? (Plus, my point wasn't that they should sell homeopathy cheaper, but that they shouldn't have it at all. It's a grand scam.)\n\nBrave new world.	1316157775

#1- I've repeated several times that I was open to the idea of a hallucination. My problem is that my situation would require two seperate people to have the same hallucination at different times. That simply does not compute. I've heard people say it could be false memories. Okay, but from what I've read about false memories the way you can tell they are false is that different people with the same false memories will have conflicting details. In my case the details were astonishingly similar. This also does not compute.\n\n#2- Have you ever considered that there may be a reason that ghosts do not show up on film? Imagine an energy field that electricly stimulates nerves but that does not emit photons. Such an energy field could theoretically be detected by the brain but not by film.

&gt;You are presenting an entirely theoretical situation (perfectly trained dogs) as a rebuttal to a real world situation (the actual record of how well actual dogs work in the actual world).\n\n\nThe point you keep missing is that real-world data tells us nothing about whether they should be used as probable cause. Let's frame this as strongly as possible: suppose that nearly all dog units in the world only have a success rate of something like 25%. Does this, in itself, mean that they should not be used as probable cause? No, of course not.\n\nThis is because of two important lines of evidence: 1) in those averaged results, there are individual dogs that are successfully detecting drugs between 80-100% of the time, and 2) when training is done properly, all dogs achieve near-perfect accuracy. What this means is that dogs are capable of successfully detecting drugs in real-world cases - we know this because of the experimental results, and the fact that individual dogs do it. The variable which is letting them down in some dog units, like the ones you've brought up, is poor training.\n\nThis necessarily means that if we fix the training, we increase the success and it becomes reasonable to use them as probable. \n\nThink of it this way: suppose nearly all hospitals in the world employed doctors who couldn't identify broken arms using X-rays better than chance, but 1) there were some doctors in those hospitals who were consistently succeeded at this, and 2) all medical students can do so. On this evidence, would you argue that X-rays shouldn't be used to identify broken arms, or that X-rays cannot be used to identify broken arms any better than chance?\n\nOf course not. What you'd argue is that something has gone wrong in those hospitals where the doctors are failing. Most likely, it would be the case that the doctors need continual training and reminders, otherwise they lose the ability they had in med school. \n\nThe same thing applies to drug detector dogs. If some dogs are doing it with near-perfect accuracy in the real world, and all dogs are doing it with near-perfect accuracy in experimental conditions, then it is a valid tool and accurate enough for probable cause. If the average dog is not scoring above 50% or higher, then it either needs to be retrained or taken out of the dog unit. \n\nIn other words, the problem is not the ability of the dogs. There is more than enough evidence that demonstrates that they can successfully identify drugs in the real world. The problem is the training and the regulations. If these criteria are not met by the dog units, then I agree that they should not, and cannot, be used as probable cause. But this argument does not suggest that dogs cannot be considered a legal justification for a search, the argument suggests that **poorly trained** dogs cannot be considered a legal justification for a search.\n\n&gt;You misconstrue the question at hand as "is it Clever Hans, or is it bad training?" when the actual question is "are police drug detection dogs working in the field accurate enough to be considered a legal justification for a search?"\n\nI'm not interpreting the question as that at all. The question is: "Are they accurate enough for it to be considered a legal justification for a search?". To answer this question, we need to assess whether some anecdotal reports of their failures are a result of their inability to detect drugs in the real world (i.e. the Clever Hans effect), or a failure of training. \n\nThere is no way to assess the question you're asking without determining whether its a Clever Hans effect or a failure of training.	1333595319

Really, this is the best [/r/skeptic](/r/skeptic) can do? Humans not having hookworm is an extremely recent development, and appears to be the cause of asthma, some allergies, and other ailments. This woman can better treat her conditions, without the severe side effects of medication, with a small dose of a parasite that millions of people live with all their lives. But your advice is that she take the drugs and deal with the side effects and worse outcomes, or somehow synthesize her own new medication from parasites? It's a symbiosis, not a dosage. Maybe you should be skeptical about modern medicine. I know, it's pretty great, but doctors have been wrong before, and they'll be wrong again.	1326835492

If the person is deep enough into the delusion about "them" being out to get "us" then it becomes a religion in and of itself.  Just like a Christian who so clearly sees that the bible is God's word and Jesus is the only path to eternal life.  If he "leads you to water" (generally that means showing you the weak ass propaganda that convinced him) and you don't drink then he is forced to conclude that you are either too stupid to understand the concept or that you just hate God/Jesus/Unicorns so much that you "see the light" but refuse to accept it.\n\nI find most conspiracy theorist have 3 bins that everyone get's put into.  Again, too stupid to see the light, too comfortable with the way things are to acknowledge the light (this is usually the point where they accuse you of being a Fox News robot) or maybe just "in" on keeping the light from other people.  I generally get put into the latter category since just like an atheist being confronted by a Christian, I can usually run circles around them using their own material (I have a fetish for conspiracy theories I guess).	1337349526

Not at all necessarily. Especially over very large studies, you would not expect certain levels of variation. Given that this is pseudo-medical (mostly psychological) observation, they are only aiming for 95% confidence (not to say they aren't MORE confident than that, 95 is just the industry standard for psych).

*sigh*.\n\nRule 1: BE NICE AND POLITE TO PEOPLE.\n\nRule 2: DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE TO PEOPLE.\n\nIf someone is lazy, they are more than free to just follow Rule 2. \n\nThere is NEVER a reason to threaten someone over something that they have said. There are obvious exceptions, I mean if someone posts a detailed plan on how to kill your family and they have attached diagrams of your house and your work schedule to it, ok sure, you can be irrate. Anything short of that, *KEEP IT CIVIL*.\n\nIf Redneck Jesus himself comes to visit, you still treat him politely.\n\nI think a lot of people responding to her in such a violent manner actually feel threatened, and thus feel justified in their response to her. \n\nThe thing is, as skeptics, they are likely already aware of what it means to have one's "fundamentals", "safe spaces", and "privilege" feel threatened. \n\nSkeptics take joy in destroying the privilege that the religious cast has over their followers. Many of us have had to go through a painful process of having our world views shattered before coming out a stronger, more skeptical and introspective, person.\n\nSo when someone starts pointing out that there may be flaws in one's beloved community, a common response is to lash out in horrible ways. This is the *exact same thing* religious groups do, and indeed groups of *any kind* do.\n\nThe thing is, we go around proclaiming we are the standard-bearers of Critical Thinking. If that is going to be true, we need to show that we can apply those same critical thinking skills *to ourselves and our own community*, rather than lash out emotionally.\n\nIf we don't, we become hypocrites just like the ones we take so much joy in lampooning.	1351115660

Also, she knows that citric acid is the active ingredient which makes this work.   \n\nWe then set up a little experiment for her, where she tasted different citrus fruits (lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange) and had her guess which one would keep a slice of apple from turning brown the longest (there was a control slice as well).  She evaluated the juice coated apple slices every morning so see which one was the least brown.\n\nShe loved it, and so did we.  2 months later she's in the bathroom with my wife, and sees a rusty pipe overhead:  "Look mommy, that's oxidation!"\n\nKids are awesome. Come to think of it, so is my wife.	1283186432

There is a tremendous amount of trust involved in science. If you're publishing about one time events (anything from a supernova to the trend in a population of endangered critters), that really can't be meaningfully replicated.  You can publish your data, you can publish your methods, but no one can replicate it to check unless they have already done so.\n\nIn fact, were photos of Bin Laden's corpse published, you would still have to rely on the accuracy of the photos, no?  What you have suggested is black and white, is in fact many shades of gray.  You're still trusting someone, unless you perform the autopsy yourself (and then we all have to trust you).	1304346937

I think you and I are mostly in agreement, then. Reasonable caution and perhaps some regulation or competition is in order. The sort of fear and loathing that leads people to burn test fields is not justified, and it would be tragic if it were allowed to divert us from such a potentially great technology.	1352327423

&gt;I ask for evidence of their claims nearly every time and they always fail to deliver.\n\nI never made any claims. I asked you to substantiate *your* claim.

Nate Silver is the 2nd biggest winner of this election. The way he became almost a household name in such a short time is amazing.

To me they are completely irrelevant and I hope something changes in american political news coverage in the future because of this.	1352296428

Welcome to r/skeptic.	1295021297
First, you're backwards: it's "like cures like" so a homeopathic preparation of acid would likely claim to cure acid burns.\n\nSecond, you will likely encounter the impenetrable claim that homeopathics cannot cause harm.  Somehow, via magic, they always help and never harm.  You can't overdose.  Good things can't be diluted to cause bad effects.  As I said: magic.\n\nAnd if something has multiple effects, the homeopathic preparation thereof only has the good effect you desire.  So, if you're having trouble sleeping, homeopathic caffeine will help you sleep but do so without, say, causing sluggish thinking or a dangerously slow heart rate (other opposite effects of caffeine).\n\nOne more time: it's magic!	1272402210

I can confirm this. \n\nI lived in Erie, PA for ten years. These are airplanes that come in over the lake. Saw this for 10 years of my life. Look closely as the first light fades out. You can clearly see the flashers on the wings. \n\nWhat you're looking at are the intense forward facing lights that all planes have. It even fades out as the plane angles away from directly facing the camera's view point. \n\nAlso, the plane IS moving. Track the background vs its position if you have any question. 	1304510652
I've had this happen as well. Actually the last time was during a job interview.  Made it a lot easier when I already knew all the questions they were going to ask.	1346848798
You're probably banned for posting idiotic generalizations and personal attacks. Atheist here(not a truther) I have met plenty of people in the atheist community that fall head over heels for this stuff. Atheist does not automatically mean smart or intellectually honest, and Christian does not automatically mean redneck bottom feeder retarded. You sound like the type of atheist that makes arguments littered with personal attacks and then wonders why nobody takes you seriously.	1351963595

The idea is that taking something to lower your temperature prolongs your illness because an elevated temperature is one of the ways out bodies kill off pathogens. By artificially reducing temperature prematurely, you extend the time it takes for your body to overcome the infection. \n\nThe trade off is to have a more intense and uncomfortable illness for a short period or have a less severe symptoms for a longer period.	1342911590

Well, me, my grandmother (under control diabetic), and my dad all drink diet and have for 5+ years and several drinks a day. I'm the only fat one and I was fat before I started drinking diet sodas. I lost about 10 pounds after switching. \n\nI've heard about the rat experiment mentioned elsewhere in this post and I've heard about it releasing gluco-somethings that binds to neurons in your brain for better or worse. Basically, no one has told me either way with anything solid as far as proof so I keep drinking 4-6 a day and I'm good. (I'm not really fat....)\n\nI also find it hard to believe that aspartame could even almost be as bad for you as 26 grams of sugar per serving. There is no possible way that a bottle of sprite with 40-50 grams of sugar (your entire daily value) is better than drinking a diet one with a little aspartame in it. 	1301141899
~~Careful, your bias is showing.~~ There are many posts on r/atheism that are examples of theists being silly but that hardly makes it a "subreddit dedicated to bashing christianity". The majority of those are from the lives of atheists in the subreddit who have no-where else to go to vent about religion. From what I've noticed very little of the venting like that spills over to r/skeptic. What r/skeptic gets is generally things like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/f4ei1/spiritually_unfit_soldiers_forced_to_hear_about/). \n\nThat post is about soldiers being forced to get spiritual wellness counseling because they have declared that they are a non-theist. Even in that very post there are people who want to give religion a special exemption from skeptical analysis with some saying ["Downvote for blogspam and for *posting in r/skeptic when this belongs in r/atheism* \\(which it was also submitted to\\)."](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/f4ei1/spiritually_unfit_soldiers_forced_to_hear_about/c1d7jpt) However, it is very much a skeptical issue as well as one of religious freedom. \n\nIf you were to take non-belief out of that article and replace it with homeopathy, saying that soldiers who took a test that determined their energy levels were low were being forced to take homeopathic remedies then there wouldn't be any question that this is a skeptical issue. How is forcing them to attend religious indoctrination sessions any less of a skeptical issue?\n\nI'll grant that there are some submissions, like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/f4hp7/how_to_get_your_children_to_believe_in_god/), that don't really belong here but those are by far not the most common religious related posts and are easily ignored. Looking through what's on the front page of r/skeptic right now that is the only religious thread I see that isn't also skeptical. The same is true of the What's New section.  If you spread it out to look at 100 links at a time you get two, the second being [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/f3rzg/how_does_satan_operate/). \n\nI think that it's more important that we don't censor then that we not see religion criticized,~~ and two threads out of a hundred hardly constitutes something you would have to sift through.~~\n\n**Edit : When I posted this I was not paying enough attention and took it out of context. The majority of the points still stand in response to the OP but make little sense as a response to this post.**	1295399634
Okay, so, I was on Reddit and saw the Jerusalem videos. Three of them are kinda up in the air as to legitimacy. Something I didnt notice in those three was the ends after the light goes up. All three videos in Jerusalem show red lights. I thought this was just them looking in the sky for where the light went and the red was crappy camera trying to pickup star lights.\n\nThen I see this video.\n\nRed lights, that eyewitnesses say are flying in formation dropping bright white lights.\n\nNow, these could very well be very unrelated, but it seemed to stand out to me. Something I had overlooked in the Jerusalem videos now seemed important though that is definately anecdotal.\n\nSo, lets take this possible scenario: red lights dropping white lights that go to ground level then shoot back up very fast. The Utah video here, people might not have seen the return of the white lights because they moved very very fast. And the people in Jerusalem might not have noticed the red lights that were already there because the white light was what they were paying attention to. \n\nJust a mini scenario but I'm probably grasping for straws here. Just wanted to tell people about it.	1296881844
In that case, do it once while blindfolded without turning the board and a second time when you do turn the board. If the board works the first time that "proves" that the spirits can see it even with your eyes closed, so you're then free to turn it during the second blindfolded session, proving that its actually your memory of the boards position being used to select what words are highlighted.	1319769104
I go to an orthopedic. He prescribed me XRays and an MRI to determine the cause of my back pain. AFAIK chiropractors just crack and realign your back. Sometimes this can be dangerous. There is a case where one woman was [paralyzed](http://www.google.com/search?gcx=w&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=paralysis+chiropractic) and my uncle had a rib broken his his chiropractic. \n\nI'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure that they can't do anything for degenerative disc disorders or herniations. 	1318387385

Other side of the argument? That's supposing what a medium says is actually true. \n\nThere is no other side of the argument because people who die don't come back to life or haunt people to tell them what the afterlife is like. Because so far, in the entire existence of humans, there has been absolutely zero proof of an afterlife in the first place. \n\nMediums feed off the emotions of the gullible. \n\nLook up James Randi. His "James Randi Educational Foundation" has offered up a $1 million dollar reward to ANYONE who can provide evidence of the paranormal. So far, every one of the over 1,000 people that have tried have failed. 	1347681397
I know that this can seem to be a ban on "religiously offensive" material. But it is in fact not. \n\nTo understand this type of wrighint, you must understand some basic jurisprudence, (legal thinking) \n\nthe key wording here is - "hate speach". It implies that a video that is meant to spur hatred towards a specific group (this group has to fall under a common - religion, race, ethinic origin, etc.). \n\nThis is directly in line with most civilized countries rights. \n\nIt does not mean that a video that wants to provide awareness about a specific issue shouldn't be published. Neither does it mean that a video arguing against a specific religion based on legitimate grounds. \n\n It just means that if the message of the video is intended to spur hatred it can be taken down. \n\nIts an issue of weighing "rights" against each other. In this case - the right to free speech against say racism.  This is actually generally accepted within democracies and does help to protect the freedom of speech and other rights. \n\n**Edit:** spelling and gramar	1330262257

She was awake, bored and home alone. Her (now ex) husband had left her alone for the night and she had nothing to do. Both of is enjoyed paranormal movies and videos and she was inspired by Ghost Hunters. The EVP gathering was also because she had other experiences in the house.

&gt;The alternative is private entities being allowed to be violent.\n\nI think you failed to read the rest of my post. Most enforcement in a market would be the result of refusal to do business with a criminal. Violence would only be considered legitimate in the act of defense against aggression.\n\nAt the risk of attacking a straw man I'd guess that you would then ask "yeah, but who is to stop a powerful private entity from using it's violence anyway". And the answer would be the same as the answer to the question "who is to stop a violent government from becoming tyrannical". The answer in both cases is the citizens. And yes, just as citizens in many countries have failed to prevent their governments from violating their own laws, citizens of a Libertarian society could fail to stop violence as well. But the fact that it is not guaranteed to last forever without diligent citizens only puts it on par with government, certainly not a point against it.\n\n&gt;because they refuse to consider that another artificial construct, i.e. private property, is the source of more oppression than most modern democratic governments\n\nPrivate property a result of the philosophy of [equality of opportunity](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/). Which I'll agree is artificial, but human equality is something almost universally accepted and is paid lip service by every government, even though the existence of the government contradicts the idea.	1343073001

Actually that isn't plausible. Satellites and space junk are moving in (mostly) random directions at extremely high speeds. The Mir itself moved at nearly 5 miles per second, and other objects orbiting at that altitude travel at a similar speed. The chances of a satellite or a piece of junk coming that close to the Mir, while it moved at a relative speed of close to zero, and coincidentally getting caught in one of the only photos of the mission that was published, is virtually nil. It would be like having two bullets collide in midair and taking a lucky photo at the instant they hit.	1352132205

(Not going to cite my sources on this one, working from memory)\n\nFrom what I understand, there's a KBO "dead zone" where there's a drastic drop-off in the number of trans-neptunian objects a ways past Pluto. It's not completely implausible that there could be *something* out there which generally fits the definition of a planet.\n\nPhil makes the valid point that there's some interesting research here, but nothing conclusive.\n\nLike most things in science, we find ourselves in the position of needing more data. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised by the discovery of an ice giant in the Kuiper belt or even in the Oort cloud. But neither would I be surprised if we established definitively that no such object exists.\n\nA long-period "nemesis planet" or companion star is completely out, though. If something was going to be within 1 AU of the sun in 22 months, it would be impossible to miss at this point.	1297749269

No idea if his backyard science experiment makes his argument valid. But it's not *sound*.\n\nIt’s all based on the assumption that what you see in this video is molten steel. So, a vast conspiracy, including ingenious chemical warfare or… what you see in the video is not actually molten steel? And it [indeed isn’t](http://911myths.com/html/wtc_molten_steel.html). It’s most likely just molten aluminum. This proves his argument unsound, until he’s able to present evidence otherwise. 	1315505124

The truth of the matter is that there is exactly zero evidence of explosives or thermite being used to bring down any of the buildings in the WTC complex.

True. In some regions, truth is not a defence. The mere losing of face is enough to win yourself a defamation case. In my opinion, this is fucked, as in this case, for example, outing an utter swine like this person as a full-retard liar, proves that she is, uh, lying! She might be able to turn it around and say that despite this being true or not, she has lost face with her legion of full-retard fans. Hence, show me the money!	1331350274

Second experience was seeing someone upstairs at the old movie theater where I used to work. It was an old 30's style movie house, and one night I saw what looked like someone walking past the booth windows when I was in the theater between shows. I went upstairs, and asked around as to who was up there, and no one else was up there.\n\nThe real kicker is that the upstairs is locked, and I was the only one with keys that day.	1351731892

ask him how far up do the 'auras' extend above the head.  Then have people stand behind a short enough wall to see the aura, but not the person, and see if he can see it.\n\nor behind a screen:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZeQGld5QBU\n\nof course both of these would humiliate him, because it would prove he's not magical.  But as a good 'woo' artist, he would blame your 'negative skeptical energy' for causing him to fail.\n\n	1285514722
A bunch of UFO sites that would be expected to cite it.  The point was that the authenticity of the quote doesn't matter since the quote itself makes no claim that the aliens helped the Nazis develop rockets.  It was clearly taken out of context, making it seem as if "we" referred to Oberth and his colleagues.\n\nIn other words, while it's not difficult to imagine Oberth believing in the existence of UFOs, given that this wasn't particularly controversial in his time, it's quite difficult to believe that he had claimed that little green men had a little rocket workshop in his toolshed.	1325186494
Out of curiosity, how much are they swindling out of people for it? You would think if it was anywhere near the $30-$40 it costs for ACTUAL flea protection, people would buy the tried and true method. Then again, it's on a "natural" website, so perhaps they're pulling in people who really believe that shit is possible. Still, I don't think I understand how someone could read a description like that and not have their bullshit detectors go off. \n\nAs for how they get away with it, my guess (and I emphasize "guess") is that since the FDA isn't involved, they can say whatever they want. I'm not sure how those people sleep at night, though, screwing people out of all that money. Perhaps all the stacks of cash make a nice pillow.	1342032919

"It's not what you say, it's how you say it."\n\nIt doesn't matter if you make a good point if you frame it in such a way that the audience comes away from it thinking "wow, that guy is a belligerent dick" instead of "Maybe I should look into that."  This isn't about you getting to feel self satisfied.  It's about educating people through careful persuasion.	1318464429
That's not really a study of a pharmaceutical though, it's a study of the placebo effect. And there is certainly ongoing research in that area.\n\nBasically, the point of a drug trial is to show whether a drug has a benefit *beyond* the placebo effect. All drugs give a placebo effect.	1263063096

&gt; "fires at the same frequency as your nerve" \n\nRight off the bat this is stupid. Nerves don't have steady frequencies. Wires that use AC do, and clocked DC lines like the ones in your computer do, but nerves don't. They have individual firing events, and higher rates of these events correspond to a stronger signal on that nerve. If your nerves had just a single frequency, they would be useless.\n\nSome unsolicited advice: Ditch the chiropractor and get a massage therapist. Find one that does cheap chair massages. Even better, find one with a good understanding of anatomy and ergonomics, because then the massage therapist will be able to discuss ways to improve your working environment so you're not in so much discomfort. If you're a desk jockey, it's worth it, even if it's not covered by insurance.	1335476565

The responses in this thread have shown me how thin the line is between a skeptic and a conspiracy theorist.\n\nObviously your questions are pointed to try and figure out if this is actually Bin Laden. I would retort that it is still only been a day since this event even happened. I have no doubt that the government wouldn't have dumped the body without making sure that they had some pretty good evidence to back this claim up. The reasons we haven't seen pictures or video probably has more to do with the fact that the event is still fresh, and releasing death photos the next day is probably not the image Obama is trying to put out there.\n\nBut I am sure that we will soon get some evidence to quiet your mind. Otherwise, I would like to point out to you that the prevailing notion among many government officials here and abroad was that Bin Laden was probably already dead. Do you think that Obama engineered a mission to make it appear that he had killed Bin Laden to reap political dividend?\n\nDo you see how quickly this ventures into conspiracy theory territory?	1304390105

No - I said NOTHING like that - I was **describing possible explanations to a very, very thin correlation!**\n\nTh only "bait" that the above post is referencing is the fact that I have specifically chosen the name of the account as to be similar enough to the nuclear one - and the fact that from time to time I am suggesting to conspiratards like you theories like above - which apparently you are immediately considering as real and you have already made a post on it:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/14ubtf/an_important_statement_from_nuclear_is_atomic/\n\nSo yes, I am guilty of messing with your conspiratard mind, but absolutely certainly I am not the one that is posting there over half of the stories suggesting that is all just a conspiracy of the climate scientists :)\n\nAnd of course you have chosen to neglect the most important part - that one where **having multiple accounts is a perfectly valid choice, the same one used by the moderator kokey/ManBearPig/gst!**	1355495256

Thanks for the info. When it happens I'm nearly always in a relaxed mode. I'm super easy going person with an easy going, mellow, low stress life style. I get at least 9 hours of sleep a night. I practice meditation, and I do tend to think this increases the awareness. I am fully "present" so perhaps that is simply why I am more apt to spot these patterns, when normally one filters such details out? \n\nWhen you drive your car to work, for example, where is your mind? Are you thinking five steps ahead to what you must accomplish when you get to the office? Or perhaps you are dwelling on a memory from the night before? Are you tuned out to your surroundings and driving on "auto pilot" because you've driven that same stretch of road day after day? Or are you fully engaged in the present and noticing the little details that change each day? When one practices such engagement, one does just happen to notice......... license plates. \n\n\n	1326668863

Not my hometown, but the areas around it (i've been to all of them btw). There's an old haunted bridge in Arlington called [screaming bridge](http://www.strangeusa.com/Viewlocation.aspx?id=9399). One of my mother's friends actually went to the same school with the kids who got killed on the bridge. Place is creepy. Another place in Denton called [Goatmans Bridge. aka old alton bridge](http://www.goatmansbridge.com/). I've been there twice. First time I felt cold spots throughout the area. Second time I went I felt cold spots, being watched, and when I walked on the bridge I received a painful headache, and felt sick. But after I walked off of the bridge, the sickness and headache went away. And lastly, [Baker Hotel](http://www.texasescapes.com/TexasPanhandleTowns/MineralWellsTexas/BakerHotelGhosts.htm) in Mineral Wells. I've been there three times. The third time I went was about 2 weeks ago, where I actually experienced something. It was some awesome/freaky shit.

&gt;&gt;one-in-a-million chances crop up nine times out of ten -- Terry Pratchett\n\nNote though that in this interpretation, you're underestimating by orders of magnitude.  Far more than one one-in-million chance happens to a person in a day.  In fact, millions happen every second, because *most* things that occur are unlikely - it's just that all other occurrances are equally unlikely.  A particular atom of oxygen collides with one particular atom of hydrogen out of all the billions of atoms, and the huge spaces between atoms?  How improbable is that.  More macroscopically, flip a coin 20 times, and the outcome, *whatever it is*, is a 1 in a million chance.\n\n(Of course, there's also the question of *defining* randomness here - From an objective view, arguably there are no random events, just deterministic occurrances that were *certain* to happen, depending on the whether quantum events are really random.  However, in terms of epistemic randomness, there's far more than one one-in-a-million event per day.\n	1296125370

Hi, once I stopped breathing because of a peanut. They had to open my throat with a pipe so that I wouldn't die. This happened when I was a teenager, and it was how I learned what an allergy is. \n\nI am also allergic to other things, like lentils and shellfish. If I eat those, my lips swell uncomfortably and I vomit, but I won't die. The vast majority of allergies are like this - annoying, but not deadly. The trouble is that someone with this milder form of allergy may one day have a severe anaphylactic attack and die, so anyone with even the mildest of known allergies should be treated like it's truly life threatening. \n\nUnfortunately the result of this (excess) precaution, and all the people out there who claim to be allergic to something to ensure they don't get it, is that the truly serious allergies are also dismissed as undue paranoia. 	1327279358

Just like nobody has the right to deliberately steal and copy the intellectual property of Monsanto, or any other company creating any other form of intellectual property.\n\nWhen they start talking about outlawing the planting of anything but Monsanto brand round-up ready crops, then we can have this hysteric debate.

The scientific method has already been applied, over and over again, to the ouija board with identical results each time: it doesn't hold up. I'm not debunking anything for mankind. It has already been done.\n\nI'm curious to know why you mention that the "craft" is 2000+ years old. Do you truly think that just because something is old, it has validity? There are a *lot* of beliefs held 2000 years ago that are hogwash now. Alchemy, for one. The placement of celestial bodies in relation to our planet. The shape of our planet. That sickness was caused by demons. I could go on and on, and even go into the treatment of women and the practice of slavery. Why did you mention that it's 2000 years old as if it's supportive to your extraordinary claim?	1335461260

Strong atheist and skeptic reporting in.  I always have a little trouble with the Dawkins scale though. I really want to put a 7, but I understand why a 6 is the rational position to take.  Thing is, I was raised in a household with no religion at all, in countries where religion just wasn't an issue - New Zealand and Australia (certainly that was true in the 70's and 80's).  I never knew what any of my friends believed and no one talked about it. I only found out about the idea of god when I was quite old, and it seemed as preposterous to me as any other fairy tale.  My family never told me that Santa Claus or the tooth fairy or the Easter Beagle (teehee) was real either... so it wasn't a case of me growing up believing something and then learning the truth.  I just always understood very clearly the difference between imagination and reality.  \n\nSo, to me, the idea of a creator seems a very irrational position to hold... saying that 'yes there is the ever so slight possibility it could be true' is like also saying 'yes there is the slight possibility that unicorns and flying teapots are true'.  Of course - in a multiverse, perhaps so, but it's hard for me to get there and feel that is an argument worth holding.  So - I guess I'm a 6.5 on my most forgiving days and a 7 on my pig-headed stubborn ones  ;)	1301986503

Plus you also need to ask the question, even if we aren't 100% sure that humans are causing global warming, do we really want to be conducting an un-supervised massive climatology experiment with unknown results that at best will do nothing, and at worst will make life as we know it change irrevocably? \n\nIf you want to be skeptical about whether or not there's enough evidence to support the idea that humans are a cause, or at the least a contributing factor, to global warming, that's one thing (although I would argue that we already know what greenhouse gasses do, and therefore it is logical to believe that if we emit greenhouse gasses, they will do what they do). \n\nBut it then must be argued that until we DO know for sure what belching those gasses into the air will do, we should limit how much of them we belch into the air in case they will do something unpleasant. \n	1328142654
It's not just that. A lot of the real dyed-in-the-wool truthers have bought into the whole "North American Union," new world order, secret Zionist overlords crap.

The basic strategy charlatans like him seem to have is simply poorly defining what they're going to talk about and then drawing crazy conclusions from it. It's frustrating to debunk them because you can't really know what they're talking about, since they have not defined it properly. This is also why it's so attractive to ignorant people, since they can shoehorn their own prejudices and thoughts on the charlatan's words.	1339990452

Hrmm,...the Telegraph,...bastion of truth,...written by the same Jasper Copping that wrote ["The UFO sighting that convinced a Govt Minister"](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/ufo/9292417/The-UFO-sighting-that-convinced-a-Government-minister.html)\n\n\n"So it seems that Copping is merely a somewhat typical UK media-hack, willing to write whatever he's told - regardless of the facts.\n\n\nThat sort of hubris and denial is also responsible for the corrupt mess that is UK's media (inc. BBC), policing, judiciary, fiscal system, bureaucracy and, over-archingly, UK's parliament.\n\n\nAfter a little observation a logical analyst learns to **discount almost all `information' from those sources and instead to look for concealed motives and activities.**" -An Insightful Man, 4 Nov 2012\n\n\nAnd just who is [the ASSAP](http://www.assap.ac.uk/newsite/htmlfiles/Investigations%20training.html) that makes them such a landmark institution in ufology that their collapse portends the doom of all UFOdom? Well, by all appearances, they investigate and train investigators for all forms of paranormal investigation, offer courses and accreditation to become an AAI (Approved ASSAP Investigators - on the National Register of Approved Investigators). Sounds legit,...and not at all profit oriented, just because there are membership fees and course fees and training fees,...and this journalist is bringing more attention to an unaccredited charitable organization that may be going under,...not quite the story he wrote, but there is a story there,...	1352212032
Right and the appropriate use of Goodwins law should not be any time someone brings up Nazis or Hitler but when they use it in a massivly exagerated or off topic way.\n\nI'm not for any discussion of Monsanto to be met with a silly reply of a falacy. The only problem I have is that Monsanto is so overused much in the way Hitler is to avoid conversation altogether by bringing a non seequitor no one reasonably agrees with.\n\n"Oh you think politician x should win you would probably like that fella named...Hitler!"\n\n"Oh you want to talk about a specific GMO and what it comprises? You probably support the terrible things Monsanto does."\n\nI do see the potential for people to abuse the fallacy and simply state its name and move on from an otherwise good conversation. Used properly I can't help seeing how good it is at pointing out the problems in many conversations about GMOs when used correctly.	1352467575

I agree correlation does not mean causation at all and yes some relief in back pain can be ascribed to time but not all.\n\nHere's a study comparing chiropractic care ( SMT ) with other pain management techniques.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21328304\n\nsummary \n\n"High quality evidence suggests that there is no clinically relevant difference between SMT and other interventions for reducing pain and improving function in patients with chronic low-back pain.

I know that years ago, when the original Ghost Hunters first started, they did a *lot* of debunking there. They caught someone trying to fake it and exposed them; they'd measure staircase steps to show that you weren't feeling a ghost push you, the steps were just slightly uneven; they have also brought up the fact that infrasonic waves and electromagnetic fields make people feel uneasy, and I forget which one it was but they debunked a guy's haunted basement just because of one of those being caused by something mechanical he owned and had down there.\n\nBut they weren't thoroughly skeptical, no.

The song “Ted Haggard Is Completely Heterosexual” is the one that introduced Roy’s music to me. Following the controversial news of the illustrious evangelist Ted Haggard’s homosexuality and crystal meth use, and the initial cover-up and denial, Roy explained the situation in song. It is noteworthy that the highly influential pastor had consistently taken positions against gay marriage, and other homosexual rights issues. He has also been known to have hosted a weekly phone call with President George W. Bush, though this situation changed abruptly. As Roy explains in the song... (video included)\n\nRoy has reworked the song before, to apply to similar situations as they made the news. I’m thinking this song is just waiting for a new version… something about a certain part of the government being completely heterosexual. (*cough cough* US Military *cough cough*) But then again, maybe he’s sick of that song since it is 3 years old now. Either way, we are in for a treat.	1298983581
Indeed. What I meant is that although the Vatican employs scientists, the Vatican's opinion itself is not of interest, since it is not a scientific organization and may or may not have scientific views on various topics (they tend to adapt their beliefs to science somehow nowadays, it still doesn't make them a scientific organization). The scientists themselves may have good reasons to be listened to however.\n\nBut I mostly agree with your conclusion.	1343082795

I absolutely do not wish to be inflammatory, but based on my own (anecdotal) observations, Hinduism is the most backwards of all the major institutionalized religions. \n\nI have spent time in India on a few occasions. I had a PhD chemist (a friend of mine) show me around his village. There, they have a rock that is apparently growing every year - it is a religious miracle. I asked him if anyone measures its mass to confirm this; I asked what size this rock should be if it has been growing for thousands of years; I asked about the conservation of mass; he did not care - it was growing. \n\nOn a different trip, I was taken to see a clock that never needs to be wound (another miracle). I asked what the door in the clock house was for, my guide apparently had never considered it. \n\nHindus, it seems, to not believe only in miracles that happened thousands of years ago, or that God cured the sick - they believe in things you could *easily* disprove if you wanted to. They don't care. Its scary stuff. 	1335030753
Entering ketosis is dangerous and should be avoided. There is gobs of science to back this up. It's akin to suggesting that one get scurvy to drop a few pounds.\n\nThe paleo diet advocates reducing fruit consumption and Carb rich tubers.  Where you're going to get carbs from is a mystery.\n\nBecause there are different opinions on the matter, doesn't mean they are equal.  This is the same argument we have with climate change deniers "there are some scientists who deny it", but the vast majority do not.\n\nIt is entirely possible that they are mistaken, it is not however likely.	1327418234

I don't think it was a non sequitur at all. That quote was given as an example of what Putnam sees as a possible solution to the diversity tension his study found.\n\nWhite Americans used to divide themselves along religious lines, just as Americans still divide themselves across racial or ethnic lines. Over his lifetime, he has noticed that the religious differences have faded from the public consciousness; white Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, etc now consider each other as part of the same group — whites, or at least white Christians[1].\n\nSimilarly, if people stopped considering racial differences a social differentiator, the "diversity challenge" of a mutli-racial society fades away. Putnam hypothesizes that this is one possible solution, but expects it to be more difficult than the religious divisions he mentioned.\n\n[1] Remember that "Christian" as an overarching term for all the various denominations of Christianity is a new thing. Protestants didn't always consider themselves coreligionists with each other, certainly not with Catholics, and absolutely not with Jews — but today we speak of Judeo-Christian values as a real thing. The old divisions and tensions have faded.	1356762934

Very scary.  Our cat Truffles had died a few weeks prior to me waking up in the night feeling as if she was walking around my bed and rubbing on me.  I never opened my eyes but I reached out to pet her and she definitely felt as if she was dead and had been decaying for quite awhile.  Matted missing fur, and boney cold skin.  I was so scared I then shot strait up to find no cat there.  I always figured it was more of an old hag night terror than my poor cat actually trying to terrify me.

I was employed there for about 5 to 6 years. I can confirm that a lot of this is misleading or untrue. Although, I will admit that sometimes it just comes down to individual store management.\n\nThe location I worked at didn't give a shit about the environment (Recycling? Reduce? Reuse? Hahaha), treated it's employees like crap, supported the Whole Body "doctors" giving medical advice and pushing snake oil, had poor standards for auditing and food labeling. And gain-sharing usually amounted to 50 bucks a month unless you worked in Whole Body. The cashiers were shit on, a lot, by everyone... but apparently the girls hanging out in the back corner of the store tossing homeopathic pills and oregano oil at anyone who stopped by deserved 10 times the gain sharing. Oh, and that food education they offered was either "green" propaganda or thinly veiled advertising for products.\n\nTheir 15 minutes of fun classes were often used to push anti-nuclear, anti-vaccination and other shitty opinions on gullible employees too afraid to ever question anything. What an awful place that was.	1349243867

If you choose to do anything about their ignorance please do it very gradually and carefully. They've already shown they are subject to confirmation bias and confrontations can easily become more about emotions and status than fact vs. fiction. Should you choose to quickly prove them wrong they will not be happily enlightened, they will be forced to grudgingly accept they've been in error for years. If you don't play it right you might not only push them further into belief but reduce your effectiveness (or even lose your job) and so condemn them to this stupidity for another 15 years or more.\n\ntl;dr Attack this foolishness slow and smart, don't lose your job. You're the only hope to resolve this little gathering of ignorance.	1350828399
More that they can make you do things that you wouldn't ordinarily do in real life, for a time after the game. Speaking personally, I can go along with that - way back when Midtown Madness (anyone remember that one?) came out, I caught myself driving more aggressively if I had to drive somewhere immediately after playing the game. \n\nI'll note that I did not bounce up on sidewalks and try to mow down pedestrians, or crash through shopping malls, or fishtail around corners trying to run away from the cops, however. \n\nThe point is that the idea that games can nudge behavior one way or another for a brief time after playing them is not entirely without merit. However, taking this to mean that if someone plays a FPS, they're more likely to go out and shoot up a school, is a very large departure from logic. \n\nI tend to agree with EffectThatAffect that games might influence people who already have mental problems, but that's more an indictment of our country's attitude toward and access to mental health care than it is of the video game industry. Anyone who's insanity is dangerous enough that a simple video game can convince them to kill a classroom full of children is someone who should have been detected, treated, and/or institutionalized for the protection of society. \n\nSo in short, even if violent video games can influence mentally ill people toward mass murder, blaming the video game is stupid. Blame the fact that the dangerously insane person is able to roam freely through society rather than get the treatment they need.\n	1356032182
Wisdom from the strangest of places here on reddit.	1330995768
I think I'm agreeing with you but after your post it's hard to say. 8-). My point was to emphasize convincing when the opposite side has some evidence (which is obviously not convincing). However, I feel an expert in some subject has the right to use the term valid as only they can evaluate it from a valid/invalid point of view.\n\nAnd I'll disagree with your last point because the evidence for health effects has in almost all cases been show to be invalid, improper or inadequate. Common sense would make one find widespread evidence of illness considering the widespread nature of power lines rather than the isolated clusters that seem to be factors of chance rather than real health effects.	1313018478

At this point, anyone talking about mercury in vaccines should make you smack your forehead.  It's largely a scare tactic and is utterly outdated (except for trace quantities, [mercury/thimerosal hasn't been in routine childhood vaccines since 2001](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/thimerosal/thimerosal_timeline.html)).  There has been no corresponding change in autism diagnosis rates, so the mercury hypothesis is effectively dead.  Anyone still forwarding you emails about it is peddling a particularly outdated brand of wack-a-loonery.  All the "cutting edge loons" are now on to blaming nondescript toxins or attacking the 200 year old science of vaccination itself.\n\nAnd, yes, there is still thimerosal in some flu vaccinations.  However, as others have said, it is about the same mercury exposure you'd get from a tuna sandwich.  Anyone claiming this quantity would violate EPA exposure/safety guidelines (another popular chorus for email fowards) is simply wrong or bad at math.\n\nWelcome to r/skeptic!

The problem with this is that whether something is real is a different matter to whether we believe it. If there was a little corner of our brain that was somehow plugged in to direct knowledge of whether things were true or not and ensured we *couldn't* belief false things, it wouldn't be an issue.  But in fact, we're confined to determining such things from evidence, reasoning or whatever epistemology we use.  \n\nAs such, there's a real need for vocabulary to describe not only what's real, but what we **think** is real - because there's always the potential for those things to differ.   Something being real or not is independent of whether I **believe** it is real, except that I (wanting by beliefs to positively correlate with reality) wish to believe it if and only if it is real.\n\nSo "real" or "fact" is talking about something different - a property of the territory rather than the map.  In describing our own model of the state of the world, "belief" is still an entirely relevent and applicable word.  If you say "evolution is real", then unless you're lying it is an accurate statement to say "ZootKoomie believes in evolution".	1309348449

It is almost exactly the opposite of acupuncture. Acupuncture says "your mind and body will change because I'm doing something silly with needles" but hypnosis says "your mind will change because I'm telling you to change it." \n\nNotice that what aupuncture says isn't true. The needles aren't important. What hypnosis says *is* true. The patient is responding to being told how to feel.\n\nHypnosis is essentially pure, unadulterated woo. Placebo that's *labelled* as placebo. Nazi rallies were hypnosis with a different label. Speaking in tongues is hypnosis with a new label. Spirit-mediums, reiki, Transcendental Meditation... It's all hypnosis.\n\nMesmerism is bullshit, though. It's the original dishonest label for hypnotism.	1298875215

The stuff on Project Blue Beam is as hilarious as ever.\n\n&gt; "The use of telepathic hypnosis also holds great potential. This capability could allow agents to be deeply planted with no conscious knowledge of their programming. In movie terms, the Manchurian Candidate lives, and does not even require a telephone call. 'Other mind-to-mind induction techniques are being considered. If perfected this capability could allow the direct transference of thought via telepathy from one mind or group of minds to a select target audience. The unique factor is that the recipient will not be aware that thought has been implanted from an external source. He or she will believe the thoughts are original."\n\nSo, if that technology existed **how could you fight it**?\n\nAnswer - You couldn't - there would be no way that you could avoid being co-opted, so why would anyone bother?\n\nI love how it mentions that the guy's kids were "kidnapped" from his house by the government.

Oh, I know they mess up both. But if it's down to taking your meds or making rather minor mods to your diet, it's kind of a toss up which does more. I'm sure it's hell on wheels for MDs - every time I've used their services (not often) for me or my kids they're always surprised at how well everything went and completely amazed that I actually did exactly what they to do. Even simple stuff like "You're kid has a broken foot. Make sure this cast stays on, don't stay on it more than an hour a day or so. Might wanna make sure calcium stays up" = "You have one hour. I'll set you up with video games, computers, etc but one hour shall be the time your foot doth move. I will give you these calcium supplements in the morning with your multivitamin. Don't worry, they're chewy and taste like chocolate".	1319509248

This is the example I have heard of.

Emphasis on appropriately planned.  I hear of B12, iron, and vitamin D being the more commonly "low" values from vegan diets.\n\nIn my experience, many vegans don't have much planning in their diets, it's more of a "is it vegan?" metric applied to food.  In being in a relationship with a vegetarian for a couple years, her diet was weighted heavily towards chips, soda, and things like pancakes.  I've met others with better diets of course.\n\nThe hormone reasoning alone isn't a particularly good one for going vegan (as noted above), but really you should be carefully managing a child's diet either way.	1343051768

What big genetic differences though? To quote Dr Pitsaladis, from the University of Glasgow, who investigates the genetics and sports performance: "Genetic studies of elite sprinters from Jamaica and the USA have not found that these athletes possess a unique genetic diversity among ethnic groups. It is unjustified, therefore, to regard ethnic differences in sporting success as genetically determined; to justify doing so one must identify the genes that are important. Until now, that has proven elusive". In addition to that, if it were just down to genes, where are, say, the Brazilian sprinters? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres#Olympic_medalists	1345052701

But they're *not* rational about what they've already convinced themselves is true. For example...I live in a murder house. I bought it from the estate of the murdered owners. I've lived here for over ten years and never experienced anything that I ever thought for one instant was any sort of supernatural occurrence. \n\nWhen woo-gullible people visit that do NOT know it's a murder house, they don't mention anything out of the ordinary. When woo-gullible people visit that DO know it's a murder house, all of a sudden there's mention of 'cold spots' and 'unusual noises' and lights turning off and on by themselves, all of which I know is not real, and which were never experienced by them until they actually found out there had been a murder here.\n\nThe mind is an incredibly suggestible thing, and irrational "experiences" like this can be contagious to others.	1343133081
we need whistle blowers with evidence. I've always wondered what the president had to sign behind closed doors after being sworn in.

As a vegan, I am exuberantly in favor of it being developed &amp; produced. While I believe the ethical &amp; environmental arguments for veganism are compelling, I'm not so naive to think that the majority of the human race will come around any time soon. People are still worshipping imaginary deities, after all. \n\nBut once available, it should allow for an industrial shift, and reduce barriers to getting real animals legal protections. For example, you can't beat your dog, but you can chop up a pig or cow after confining it painfully for months or years. If you can buy vat-grown beef or ham, then there's less justification to deny the same level of protection to the animals.\n\nHowever, would I *eat* it? Probably not. Not out of ethical objection, but an aesthetic one. 22 years without eating meat, the stuff is just disgusting to me.\n	1288039457

You speak as if you assume I don't believe in UFO phenomenon, well its been 60 years since Roswell and yet no exposure so either the coverup is very well executed or these kinds of sightings are basically filing the perpetual need for people to create a narrative thats alluring to them.\n\nI read Leslie Keans book, to be honest I'm surprised she attached her name to this flimsy "evidence" I preferred [Mirage Men](http://www.amazon.com/Mirage-Men-Mark-Pilkington/dp/1845298578/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331826210&amp;sr=8-2) in order to gain a fresh perspective 	1331826328

Checking around further it seems that at the time he was heavily criticised by scholars and seems to have faded into obscurity, I can't manage to find much of that criticism though. In general I can only seem to find crank websites supporting his claims.\n\nIt doesn't look like there is anything to it.\n\nIt is also an unnecessary hypothesis to explain the origin of a religion. Humans are superstitious enough without drugs. Certainly Christians these days don't need to use drugs to maintain belief. Furthermore, even if it was true, so what?! So a major religion originated along with the use of a psychedelic mushroom? Even if that were true, it would have no bearing upon the truth value of the claims made by Christianity.	1355820345

You can't heat blood for transfusions over a certain temperature.  Since microwaves do not heat evenly, if you put blood in there, pockets would be hot and pockets would be cool.  When you take it out and mix it, it would all be the correct temperature, but you would have damaged the blood that got too hot.  I assume that this is what happened to the alleged patient that died from a microwaved blood transfusion.\n\nAnyone who thinks that microwaves are evil and going to kill us all with their protein-modified food is pretty much nuts.\n\nThere are arguments that it "alters" the food somehow.  All it does is heat it.  In fact, in most cases, it can't even heat it above the temperature of boiling water.  Frying or baking does more damage to the food than microwaves.  (Browning, crisping, all the things that make food tasty, are less healthy than microwaved food.  But hey, they're delicious, right?)\n\nThere is no evidence to back up their claims.	1333025146
They do. Most of them do now. The difference, though, is that with cell phones you aren't allowed to use autodialers. You have to manually dial everything. It's kind of ridiculous because all that's doing is giving people repetitive motion injuries, which almost certainly costs more than a few extra calls to cell phones, but what are you gonna do? Personally, I suggest not working in a call center.\n  \nWe also offered cash incentives for cell users on some studies.\n  \nOne of the things you want to remember, too, is that this work is contracted. The CDC doesn't go do the legwork themselves, and neither does Pew. They design an instrument and they hand it to roughly a thousand people to play with. Many of those people *suck*. Miscoding was rampant at a few of the other places. Ours was pretty good, but I wrote a *lot* of problem sheets about people miscoding and fabricating stuff. Faking out screeners so they could get into the body with *whoever was cooperative* regardless of whether or not they met the criteria, stuff like that. I've heard of people faking whole interviews. I'd imagine that increases the margin of error. 	1338905405

My best case of this happened last year. I was trying to find a document attachment in my gmail and did a search on a keyword. In the search results was an email from over a year previous from a girl I dated very briefly when I lived on the other side of the country, in CA. I opened it and it contained a photo of her. I closed it and thought nothing of it.\n\nThe next day she sends me a friend request on facebook. Zero communication between us since we dated, and I was now living in New York. There was no connection between us, we had zero chemistry or spark and never remained in contact yet I find a photo of her and within 24 hours this woman contacts me completely out of the blue. To add more weirdness, she was coming to the city the next day for business. 	1327077789
I grew up in Clearwater and have had a lot of contact with this group of people. I have worked for scientologist ad agencies in town. They are, on the whole, a sorry lot of misinformed and uneducated dupes who get suckered into classes and guilted into sticking around and donating their labor and capital to what they perceive as the greater good. Most stick around for a while, lose everything and leave looking to pick up the pieces, others get hooked for life. \n\nNo scientologist gets onto the bridge thinking the SouthPark version of the tale is true, in fact low level Scien-os will argue and plain faced tell you that's all propaganda from an unkind media/psychiatry conspiracy, they keep the origin stories and superpower secrets from you until you are properly indoctrinated. The ones who know the South Park version is actually 100% true keep their mouths shut because anything that detracts from the credibility of scientology detracts from their personal claim to superpower that cost them decades and thousands of dollars to accrue (and they probably secretly suspect its bullshit too, but its bullshit that gets them big time sway inside the scientology bubble, so it's bullshit they keep to themselves, a perpetual poker bluff) \n\nWhen you have power inside a bubble and nowhere else, guess where you stay. Low level scientologists look up to OTs like other people look up to professional athletes. \n\nI have so many stories about oddities and stupefying WTF moments interacting with scientologists its ridiculous, they are interested and believe in nearly every kind of woo you can name, every last topic on Quackwatch.org is a thing a scientologist will be into or interested in if you frame it properly. \n\n"the _authority establishment_ wants you to think_______ but _______ has known for thousands of years that the real way to _______ is ________ but _establishment authority__ is trying to supress it!

I don't know of any literature which has specifically set out to demonstrate it in babies, but theoretically there is no reason why not. The placebo effect does not require any conscious expectation of what the result is supposed to be, as it can occur through basic classical conditioning. This is why the placebo effect works in animals, despite the fact that they have no verbal capabilities or ability to expect complex abstract consequences. \n\nThis article does a good job of summarising some of the research into the effects of classical conditioning on placebo responses: [The Placebo Effect: Dissolving the Expectancy Versus Conditioning Debate](https://www.ptsdforum.org/c/gallery/-pdf/1-42.pdf). Unfortunately, the entire premise of the article is a little flawed, presenting expectation effects and conditioning effects as if they were separate processes, so take some of their conclusions and inferences with a grain of salt. Their discussion on previous research is spot-on though. 	1323997830

Yes, I have.  I did tarot readings for several years during college.  Not to disappoint you, but I was not a believer in any supernatural sources (not to say that one does not creep oneself out from time to time).\n\nI never charged money except at fundraisers for student organizations (specifically at Halloween parties, where the entertainment atmosphere is self-evident).  Owing to that, no guilt whatsoever.\n\nNow, here's the thing, tarot cards do "work" for some narrow definitions of "work."\n\nTarot cards "work" by allowing the reader to say things that would be offensive if said by a friend or stranger.  When I accuse someone of cheating on a girlfriend, for example, it wasn't me "it's in the cards."  The (completely mundane) information provided through a tarot reading is provided consequence-free.\n\nI never learned or utilized any formal cold-reading techniques.  I didn't have to, either.  People who actively seek out tarot readings are open books.  They come with friends, they wish to be impressed.\n\nHere's something else tarot cards "work" at.  A deck of tarot cards, if studied as though it were a novel or work of art, contains a wide variety of broad-spectrum ideas, each of which is narrow enough to be "helpful" while being broad enough to be hard to miss.  Any given spread of tarot cards can apply to any situation.  In this sense a tarot deck is a good self-analysis tool in the same way that a set of dice inscribed with commonly-used psychoanalysis phrases would be.  That is to say, not highly effective, but moderately effective.  The same moderate benefit applies to reading for others.\n\nFinally, I must add, that whenever anyone came to me as a tarot reader seeking help with serious personal problems I referred them directly to the counseling center on campus and refused to do a reading for them.  This shit is for entertainment and good-humored introspection, NOT real help.\n\nNow, once a person has sat down I would require them to ask a question.  Since I wasn't there to prove anything to the Amazing Randi, I shamelessly required them to provide me my first hook.  I would interpret the cards honestly, but in light of their question, and most often they would draw their own conclusions and, bizarrely, attribute those insights to me.  I can't really explain why it is that subjects so willingly count everything as a hit, especially when one refuses to voice a question and I simply spent twenty minutes explaining the meaning and context of the cards and positions to them while they silently bug-eye at me in astonishment.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, I'll happily answer them.  I won't entertain accusations of fraud, because I never, not once, claimed supernatural powers, never accepted money outside of a charity setting, and never allowed a person to take advice from a deck of cards about things that require counselors or psychiatrists.  Also, any questions you ask me won't be answered until tomorrow night.  A man has to work.	1350879014

&gt;So while you're partially right, he's not outright saying that Watson fought off an elevator rapist, but he's strongly hinting that elevator rapists strike a lot and Watson was in potential danger.\n\nWell, let's go to the *whole* tape, and not just a selected quote presented out of context:\n\n&gt;It started with a fairly straightforward story about a clueless man putting a woman in an uncomfortable situation.\n\n..\n\n&gt; This man may have had nothing but noble intentions, but that doesn’t matter. \n\nI think with clarifications like that, it's difficult to interpret his comment as arguing that this situation was 'narrowly avoided rape'. The entire article is framed from the perspective that Watson was in, where she had no idea whether this guy was a nice guy or not, and how this makes it reasonable for her to protect her own safety. \n\nSo I don't think it's fair to describe his article as discussing a "narrowly avoided rape", as it quite clearly is focused on the real concerns women have about potential rapes and assaults.\n\n&gt;My problem is with female skeptics saying that men don't understand that they're scared of rapists and because they're men, they don't understand how easily they can be threatening. We understand they're scared but there's only so much we can do to soothe their fears if they choose to be afraid in every situation and condescendingly tell us that we just don't get it is not the way to communicate with us.\n\nThe point is that men don't understand. We have some indication, and we can try to understand it from our own perspective, but at the end of the day we'll never actually know what it's like to be constantly aware of our surroundings, fearing turning our backs on strangers who look like reasonable and nice people, etc etc. \n\nInstead of complaining that it's condescending to be told you don't understand and that there's "only so much we can do", why not just try to take the time to appreciate their concerns and treat them as valid issues? There's no need to dismiss or diminish them on the basis of their factuality makes you feel sad.\n\n&gt;Like I said, her original post was not at all problematic and Dawkins sounded like an ass. It's doubling down on the hyperbole by her fans that's the problem. I've been clear about this since comment one.\n\nBut I still don't understand how the hyperbole from her fans caused you to change your position on Watson's concerns. Were you initially judging her concerns on the basis of how her fans responded to her, and when they changed their approach then you did too?\n\nWhy not just judge Watson's position and concerns on the basis of what she says?\n\n&gt;No, there isn't.\n\nOf course there is. The first is a judgement of other people, the second is a description of someone's feelings and perspective.\n\n&gt;We can all live in fear of someone bigger than us can attack us and do horrible things to us.\n\nAnd if you, in your dodgy neighbourhood, were careful about pulling your wallet out when in close proximity to strangers, or got jumpy when someone followed you down a dark alleyway, then that would be entirely reasonable. It would be fucking ridiculous for someone to listen to your concerns and fears and say: "Can't you just judge these people based on who they are? Why make judgements about them before knowing them?!". \n\n&gt;Hardly. You would just be making yourself paranoid and frightened when the probability of you being stabbed are statistically insignificant.\n\nYou're just talking shit now. You would be absolutely comfortable with a complete stranger standing around with a knife? You'd just figure that maybe he was a chef and he was on his way to work with his own tool kit or something? \n\nFuck no. If someone has a knife you don't give a shit whether he volunteers at a children's hospital and cured all diseases - you stay at least 2m out of reach. If he comes up to hug you, you back away. \n\n&gt;This is the germ of the same argument used by conceal-and-carry advocates. Why should they open themselves up to risk? Maybe it's a good idea to carry a gun, you know, just in case of trouble?\n\nFalse analogy. People carrying guns increase risk and can accidentally hurt other people, whereas leaving your details with a friend before a date or not turning your back on a stranger in an elevator has no such repercussions. \n\n&gt;But it is. I don't know any man who takes someone on a first date to some secluded forest rather than a coffee shop or a popular restaurant.\n\nBut we do know many men who don't see a problem with propositioning a woman in an elevator. Or coming by their place of work when they say they don't want to date them, in an attempt to convince them otherwise. Or putting their arms around girls they don't know, etc.\n\n&gt;But the discussion goes beyond that, down to how far away we should stand from a woman, how loud we are to speak to her, how we are to look at her for the first time, how we are to walk towards her, etc.\n\nThe first is obviously uncontroversial - nobody can be annoyed at the fact that standing too close to people is creepy and disturbing. I haven't heard anything about how loud to speak, but the way you look at her (leering at their boobs for an entire conversation is creepy) and the way you approach her (don't come up from behind) are, again, uncontroversial and nobody can be annoyed at that.\n\n&gt;They do, but we're applying the Schrodinger's Rapist logic and grading them on a scale of how gold-diggery they are just by the fact that they're women.\n\nBut the whole point of the Schrodingers Rapist logic is that the existence of this fear compels us to behave in different ways to accommodate the fears of these people. Women already do this, so I don't see what the problem is. \n\n&gt;This is usually when the men go "wait a minute... something's not right here."\n\nIn such cases the emotional coercion is a problem and I think it would be fair to do your own PSA on how women need to understand the concerns and fears of men by letting them wear condoms if they want to. \n\nAgain, the difference I think is that the vast majority of women would be in agreement making the announcement a little redundant, whereas with the Schrodinger's Rapist situation, many men still don't understand the problem - *why should I change my behavior? not all men are rapists! they're just overreacting. I fear getting mugged too but I don't treat all people as muggers! etc etc.* \n\n&gt;That's so very telling. Men can have a privileged viewpoint which is why they don't understand [blank]. Women can't have a privileged viewpoint, therefore [assumptions about a problem men deal with rather than women]. Do you see what you're doing here?\n\nYes, I'm using the term "privilege" correctly, whereas you seem to be interpreting it as "perspective". \n\nPrivilege is the unearned advantage that people receive for belonging to what is considered "normal" (i.e. white, male, able-bodied, straight, etc). It's impossible for a woman to be privileged because they aren't what is considered the norm - i.e. they aren't male. (They can of course be privileged in other ways, like being straight or white, but this privilege is not a result of their sex). \n\nJust because women can't be privileged does not imply that they understand everything about men, or their concerns, or can make assumptions about their experiences. Women have no idea on what it is like to be the privileged group in terms of sex, so they won't be able to fully understand the experience of men. \n\n&gt;Terrific, but again, I think you missed the point. I was being sarcastic and using post-modernist terminology to turn the argument on its head.\n\nExcept your failure to understand the term you were using resulted in you making a nonsensical comment, rather than turning the argument on its head.\n\n&gt;No, not always. Otherwise you wouldn't have cases where women get pregnant by lying about birth control and then demanding child support or marriage when the man finds out. Have you really never heard of this sort of thing happening or do you live in a region where all women are saints?\n\nYou're severely missing the point here. Everybody agrees that any woman that does that is a scumbag - men and women. If someone says, "Hey, I don't think it's fair that men shouldn't be allowed to wear a condom when they want to", then practically everybody in the entire world will say, "Yeah, that's pretty shitty - anyone who tries to make you stop using one is an asshole". \n\nCompare that to the situation of women saying that they're concerned about being attacked in vulnerable situations. Do we get agreement? No, we get shitty apologetics and invalidation. We treat concerns of men in vanishingly rare and practically non-existent situations (the girl getting herself pregnant) as hugely important and talk about how we have a friend of a friend that heard of a girl that did that once, and we get all up in arms about how shitty they are. \n\nWe raise the very real, very constant, very serious concerns of women, and they basically get told to shut up. \n\n\n	1348366392

I was in so much pain last year.  I really tweaked my back. \n\nTo stand up, I would sort of roll over, plant my feet on the ground, and sort of do a push up off my knee.\n\nIt got unbearable, to the point that I was considering going to a chiropractor because I knew I could see one that day, instead of waiting to get an appointment at a physio-therapy clinic and going through diagnosis etc etc.\n\n3 days later, the pain was pretty much gone.  If I had broke down and gone to the chiro, I would have given him the credit for it.\n\nAs far as "adjustments" and that crap goes, it has the same success rate as doing nothing.\n\nHowever, most chiros have pretty advanced diagnostics, and if you have one leg shorter than another, or lowered arches, they're one of the best people you can see to get fitted for orthotics (besides a real doctor of course).	1322334482

The problem with herbal medicine is a category error. There are medicines that are derived from herbs, but the herb factor is incidental. There's nothing intrinsically medicinal about herbs, and a true herbal remedy (one that isn't just an isolated molecule created by a plant) contains hundreds of other chemicals that can range from benign to toxic, mother-nature's pesticide. Thus in ascribing to herbal medicine one betrays their cultural and ideological motives, like a nostalgia for Native and mystic cultures or a belief that herbs are somehow subversive. 	1303997232
I think you are right on especially about the ego driven desire to be special. I'm not theorizing that earth is the central hub of the universe, just what reasons some ETs might have to be coming other than to mess with our heads based on what information we currently have access to. \n\nWhat I'm really trying to get at maybe can be understood better using your metaphor with lightening.\n\nSomeone had to theorize where lightening was coming from if not from god for us to be able to test that hypothesis. If we don't allow for some degree of imagination we will be confined to the current perspective.\n\nI don't disagree I just think a healthy balance of skepticism and hypothesizing are important to progressing our understanding of the universe. \n\n"knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.” -A.E.	1345673882

I totally agree with you that one study doesn't prove anything. I think the point is that it is a promising novel area of anti-cancer research. PubMed had nearly a thousand papers linking cannabinoids and cancer in some way [link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=cannaboinoid%20and%20cancer). These are all published papers. I think to discount cannabinoid's anti-cancer promise is a bit sort sighted. (btw i'm not saying anything about chemotherapy, that's a conventional cancer treatment and comes under a different category entirely). \n\nI dont see how the autism/vaccines thing is pertinant to this. IIRC there was only one published paper showing that link and that was retracted by the author because he had falsified data.	1338585421

&gt;You gave me a mountain of information! Thank you so much!\n\nNo problem, I'm glad what I wrote made sense.\n\n&gt;I got really worried when people were hammering other people online for having a 6 week old puppy and were pleading with others to call the owners to take them back and wait a couple of weeks.\n\nYeah, sometimes it can be a sign of a bad breeder or a puppy mill, where they just get the mothers to pop out babies and they send them out into the world, but sometimes it is just dedicated breeders minimising the amount of time before being able to sell them. This is because you can start weaning at about 3 weeks and weaning them about 2 weeks, it means that you can safely sell them at around 5 weeks without any long term negative effects. \n\nThe "8 weeks" figure should be treated more of a guideline, rather than a strict number where dogs will be fucked up if they are taken before that point, and perfectly healthy if taken afterwards.\n\n&gt;As for vaccinations, there are suggestions to socialize later like around 1 year, but isn't that what the vaccination at 4-5 weeks is for?\n\nStart socialising at 1 year? That would go against everything I've read and certainly wouldn't recommend it. If your shots are up to date, then yes they are as protected as they would be a day later as they are a year later - there is no advantage to waiting a year before socialisation, and many obvious disadvantages.\n\n&gt;I don't understand how Parvo works or dog viruses work but if you keep the shots up to date, why is it still dangerous to take your vaccinated pup to a dog park? Can Parvo still infect after the first vaccination? Do you need all three vaccinations before it is considered safe?\n\nIt's recommended that you wait (if I recall correctly) a week after the last Parvo shot before taking them out but this is more of a extra safety precaution and as long as you aren't taking them somewhere that is notorious for Parvo outbreaks, there shouldn't be a problem. \n\nAnd yeah, Parvo can still infect after the first injection, you need all three. Each one reduces the chances of catching it I think, to some degree, but it's not recommended to go out until all three have been given. For interacting with other puppies, it's usually just recommended that you get the first injection and they should be fine playing with each other.\n\n&gt;I'm glad I haven't doomed my puppy yet. I'm sure all the alpha stuff catching on is from Caesar Milan.\n\nHaha no, you should be fine. My general philosophy is that you're inevitably going to fuck up some things but as long as you're actively interested in doing the best for the puppy, and willing to put in the work to fix mistakes, then you'll be doing better than most dog owners. My best advice would be to keep in mind that it's easier to stop a puppy learning a bad behavior than it is to correct a bad behavior that is occurring. This means that if you don't want your dog to beg for food when you're eating, never feed it from the table and always put food in their bowl. It's so easy to slip up and think, "Oh, it'll be fine if I just do it once" but this is quite literally the worst thing you can do. \n\nAs for Cesar - agreed, he is almost single handedly responsible for keeping the dead theory alive but unfortunately he is still just one person among many who believe that crap. Browse /r/dogs for a while and you'll find most people there believe at least some aspects of dominance theory. \n\n&gt;I very much appreciate the serious and thoughtful answer and it looks like you took a lot of time out of your day to make someone more aware and knowledgeable and I feel like this is the true power of Reddit.\n\nAh, it's no problem at all.

Paraphrased conclusion:\n\n&gt;To date, 46 studies involving 1175 volunteers with IEI-EMF have tested whether exposure to electromagnetic fields can trigger the symptoms reported by this group. These studies have produced little evidence to suggest that this is the case or that individuals with IEI-EMF are particularly adept at detecting the presence of electromagnetic fields. On the other hand, many of these studies have found evidence that the nocebo effect is a sufficient explanation for the acute symptoms reported in IEI-EMF. Thus while continued experimental research in this area will be required to clarify the role of chronic exposures and to test the effects of new varieties of electromagnetic emissions, the best evidence currently available suggests that IEIEMF should not be viewed as a bioelectromagnetic phenomenon. Despite this, some commentators continue to discuss the condition without sufficient reference to this literature [Carpenter and Sage, 2007; Goldacre, 2007]. This is regrettable and suggests that the scientific community should do more to communicate the current state of the art in this area. In the meantime, when faced with someone who describes subjective symptoms that are apparently associated with exposure to an electrical device, it would be wise for clinicians and policy makers to begin with the assumption that an alternative explanation for these symptoms may be present, either in the form of a conventional organic or psychiatric disorder, or in terms of the more subtle psychological processes associated with the nocebo response. In the latter case, treatment based on cognitive behaviour therapy may be helpful for some patients [Rubin et al., 2006a].	1335795065

Once the water vapour nucleates to form small droplets it then [coalesces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescence_%28meteorology%29) until the droplets are large enough to fall as rain.	1354401694

&gt;Joe Rogan is no snake oil salesman.\n\nHe is, however, a bit of a crackpot. He's a 9/11 truther, a moon landing denier (seriously), and a believer in all sorts of woo and conspiracy theories.\n\nHe can be totally reasonable at times, but he's so wrapped up in nonsense that I've lost much of the respect I once had for him.\n\n*Edit*: Wait... prescription? Who is prescribing these?	1319464245
Reading further, Sagan does seem to agree with that viewpoint:\n\n&gt; But I am very pleased that we were able, through logic and physics, to get\n&gt; the story at least partly right, and to demonstrate that there are enormous\n&gt; elevation differences on Mars, elevations much vaster than Lowell had\n&gt; expected. I find it more difficult, but also much more fun, to get the right\n&gt; answer by indirect reasoning and before all the evidence is in. It's what a\n&gt; theoretician does in science.  But the conclusions drawn in this way are\n&gt; obviously more risky than those drawn by direct measurement, and most\n&gt; scientists withhold judgment until there is more direct evidence\n&gt; available. The principal function of such detective work – apart from\n&gt; entertaining the theoretician – is probably to so annoy and enrage the\n&gt; observationalists that they are forced, in a fury of disbelief, to perform\n&gt; the critical measurements.	1322126150
Notice that they never invoke god, or any other answer for that matter. The courts have consistently ruled that Creationism (in whatever form it takes) can't be taught in schools, so the new tactic is simply to try and poke holes in evolution.	1307679295
They might co-ordinate an anniversary attack on the 911^th anniversary of the event, so watch out for that one I guess.	1342409261
